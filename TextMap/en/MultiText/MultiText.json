It sank into the sea due to the terrain changes during the Lament, and only recently resurfaced. \nThis research station has a depth of over ten thousand meters reaching the Moho, and there is a trend to continue to expand downwards. At the same time, there seems to be a periodic echo coming from the deep well, as if it is breathing. Therefore, the deep well has also gained the nickname of the Gate of Hell. \nWithout a doubt, humans do not have the industrial capacity to build such a facility. At the bottom of the deep well, countless mysteries are waiting to be unveiled...\n\n【<color=#c19f51>Exploration Cycle</color>】\nThe environment of the Tower of Adversity naturally recovers in a <color=#c19f51>two-week</color> cycle, and the data and monsters will be updated after the cycle is reset.

The explorer can choose to manually unlock the Resonators, but after the unlock, the exploration points of the current area will be reset. \n\n【<color=#c19f51>Exploration Rules</color>】\nExplorers need to conduct multi-layer exploration in each area, each layer of exploration has a certain time limit. If the exploration is not completed within the time limit, it will be judged as a failure; if all the monsters are defeated within the time limit, it will be judged as a pass. \n\n【<color=#c19f51>Exploration Degree</color>】\nWhen the explorer is exploring the surface layer, the relay layer, and the deep layer, the exploration degree will be evaluated in real time according to the explorer's performance.

    "Character_JiYan_9_4": "{PlayerName}, did you notice anything unusual before the Gulpuffs went out of control?",
    "Character_JiYan_9_7": "Just now, there was a strange voice that interfered with our team radio, but it disappeared in a flash.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_8": "Wenshu, let's evacuate the spectators first. Send them back to Jinzhou in batches.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_9": "还有很多组人都没上场……今年这届竞渡会好不容易办起来，就这么突然收场怕是会扫了大家的兴。",
    "Character_JiYan_9_10": "Regarding the strange voice you mentioned, could it be the cheers of the spectators?",
    "Character_JiYan_9_12": "I see. I thought the Gulpuffs were just frightened...",
    "Character_JiYan_9_13": "The real cause is something else.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_16": "The data is being transmitted. Until we figure out the real cause, let's send the spectators back.",

    "Character_JiYan_9_18": "When the chaos happened, a spectator was playfully carried around by a Gulpuff and seemed to really enjoyed it. Now, other spectators are eager to give it a try as well...",
    "Character_JiYan_9_19": "They're all excited, so I guess it will take some time to evacuate them.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_20": "Let's get him to move first and those bystanders will naturally disperse.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_21": "Wenshu, I'm going with you.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_23": "当然了！大家都认可你的实力，如果漂泊者你肯出面，帮我们安抚下群众，进展肯定会顺利不少。",
    "Character_JiYan_9_25": "Thank you.",

    "Character_JiYan_9_24": "No problem. Let's go.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_27": "When {PlayerName} came ask me to team up with {himorher}, I heard a similar voice by the racing lane.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_28": "Just in case, I've already requested the Academy to collect the monitoring data of the waterways in the whole area.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_26": "No.",
    "Character_JiYan_9_29": "What happened?",
    "Character_JiYan_5_1": "You... You managed to rope the general in?",
    "Character_JiYan_5_2": "Greetings, General Jiyan, {PlayerName}.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_3": "{PlayerName} has told me what happened. I will join you.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_4": "Hooray! Now we can join the race! With General Jiyan and {PlayerName} on our team, maybe we can even aim for a new record!",
    "Character_JiYan_5_5": "I don't wanna disappoint you, but as a temporary team that hasn't been trained together, it's rather difficult to hit the record. Unless...",
    "Character_JiYan_5_6": "Unless what?",
    "Character_JiYan_5_7": "Uh, sorry, forget about it.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_9": "Here's the thing. Ten years ago, a team set the record in the Gulpuff Relay race. That record remains unbroken to this day.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_10": "Since then, every time the Riverside Games are held, a major highlight of the Gulpuff Relay is whether the record will be broken.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_11": "没错没错，我本来还想学习学习他们的策略呢，结果那年的影像居然早被借走了，一直都没还回来。",
    "Character_JiYan_5_12": "They set the record. They must have trained together for a long time.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_13": "Even if you did get that video recording, we wouldn't have been able to learn much from it as a temporary team.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_15": "Keep your chin up. Your hard work will pay off.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_16": "A temporary team has its advantage. Not to mention the team that set the record was a temporary team, too.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_17": "General, so you've heard of that race too!",
    "Character_JiYan_5_18": "Yes. That was a... good race.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_19": "*sigh* It's been ten years. I wonder how the members of that team are doing now.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_20": "We should worry about ourselves first... There's not much time left, and we haven't even decided the relay order.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_21": "Ah, the relay order... It used to be decided by the captain...",
    "Character_JiYan_5_22": "Then... General, can you decide it for us?",
    "Character_JiYan_5_23": "I trust your expertise in determining the relay order, as you have trained together extensively. I will gladly cooperate to the best of my abilities.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_24": "Alright... in that case, I think Ganquan would be perfect as the first runner!",
    "Character_JiYan_5_25": "Me... the first? Seriously?",
    "Character_JiYan_5_26": "You've always been the first runner during our training. Surely you'll make a good start!",
    "Character_JiYan_5_27": "The first runner doesn't need to coordinate with the two of us; he only needs to exchange the controller with Lingyan. It's a safe arrangement indeed.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_28": "Whew—I'll do my best.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_30": "嗯……至于漂泊者和将军，我是这么想的。",
    "Character_JiYan_5_31": "General, can you be the connecting third runner? Since you're familiar with both {PlayerName} and us Midnight Rangers.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_32": "A reasonable strategy. I agree.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_33": "Then the relay order would be me first, followed by Lingyan, then General Jiyan, and finally {PlayerName}.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_34": "{PlayerName}, this is your first race, and you may receive plenty attention as the last runner. Remember to stay calm and relax.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_38": "That's a relief.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_39": "Once I arrive at the exchange zone, go for the goal and don't look back. I'll take care of the rest.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_40": "I've always trusted your capabilities.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_41": "Any other questions?",
    "Character_JiYan_5_42": "Yes!",
    "Character_JiYan_5_43": "Our team doesn't have a name yet!",
    "Character_JiYan_5_44": "test/Since {PlayerName} brought this team together, maybe we should let <m>him</m><f>her</f> decide the name.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_49": "Good, it sounds easy to remember.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_50": "I'm starting to crave some buffalo wings too...",
    "Character_JiYan_5_51": "Not bad. It helps to release the tension.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_52": "We can have this as the team name, though I wouldn't call myself a genius.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_53": "Considering your character, I was expecting something... different.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_54": "Nevertheless, it is a good name. I have no objection.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_55": "The name is settled, then. Everyone, please get ready in your designated exchange zones.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_56": "Once the race begins, we can stay in touch using our terminals.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_8": "Wait, what record?",
    "Character_JiYan_5_35": "A piece of cake.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_36": "Butterflies are fighting in my stomach.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_37": "You'd be surprised.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_45": "Team Rover.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_46": "Team Gulpuffalos.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_47": "Team Jiyan's Genius Head.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_48": "Team PowerPuff Heroes.",
    "Character_JiYan_5_57": "I didn't expect that.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_1": "Ganquan, can I go back after watching the race?",
    "Character_JiYan_42_2": "The race has ended.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_3": "What's wrong?",
    "Character_JiYan_42_5": "Where are her guardians?",
    "Character_JiYan_42_6": "*sigh* You see, that's the problem. She managed to sneak in here. I'm getting in touch with her parents.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_7": "Please don't call my mom. She'll be angry with me.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_8": "If you know your mother's gonna be angry, then why did you sneak out?",
    "Character_JiYan_42_9": "Hmm...",
    "Character_JiYan_42_10": "Be honest.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_12": "I haven't seen him for a long long time, so I thought maybe I could meet him here.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_15": "The last relay? That was three years ago. What's your father's name?",
    "Character_JiYan_42_17": "Oh... Kongqing.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_21": "Do you know my dad?",
    "Character_JiYan_42_22": "Yes. We happened to stay in the same camp before.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_27": "Yes, but I need you to go home first.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_29": "Pinky swear.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_31": "Let's go, Ganquan!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_32": "Alright, let's go.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_33": "漂泊者，麻烦你了，我先带她回去了。",
    "Character_JiYan_42_37": "Great! Can you take me to my dad?",
    "Character_JiYan_42_39": "I promise I never lie!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_40": "{PlayerName} is the witness. Pinkies!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_4": "Hi, {PlayerName}. Here's the thing. This kid doesn't want to go home unless she can finish watching the race.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_11": "I came here to see my dad. He won the silver medal in the last relay!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_16": "Kongqing!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_23": "But he's busy! Super super busy! So he didn't participate in today's race.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_24": "My mom told me he's fighting monsters.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_26": "Really!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_28": "You can't lie to me!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_30": "Pinkies!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_34": "Be safe.",
    "Character_JiYan_42_36": "I came here by myself!",
    "Character_JiYan_42_38": "Yes, he's been asked to fight the monsters. When I'm back, I'll ask your dad to give you a call.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_1": "It seems that they're going to suspend the race and have everyone return to Jinzhou. Is that true?",
    "Character_JiYan_41_2": "Yes, because there is a security risk. I'm here to take you to the safe zone.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_4": "Safety first.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_5": "Ohh! You must be the contestant that ran in front!",
    "Character_JiYan_41_6": "It's a pity that the race was suspended... I was really excited to see your performance!",
    "Character_JiYan_41_8": "Thank you, looking forward to your next recording.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_9": "Thank you, but don't bother.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_11": "Eh? Is it bad? I think it's good.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_12": "Anyway, let's hurry up and leave here.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_13": "I'm sorry. t's my sister's first time at the Riverside Games. She's really passionate about photography, so she got a bit carried away when talking about her work.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_14": "No worries.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_16": "I still have more than half of my camera's memory left. I wanted to snap more amazing moments to submit!",
    "Character_JiYan_41_17": "Don't worry. The organizing committee will surely make follow-up arrangements. However, for now, please return to Jinzhou for your safety.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_18": "Alright, let's follow the command.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_19": "*sigh* Fine. At least I've got two wonderful photos — the overtaking Rover and the Gulpuff carrying a man.",
    "Character_JiYan_41_3": "*sigh* I was hoping to snap a few more shots of the guy on the Gulpuff. Bad luck!",
    "Character_JiYan_41_7": "Especially your performance! That's brilliant! See, I even recorded a video!",
    "Character_JiYan_41_10": "Hurray! My camera only captures the best and the most moving moment!",
    "Character_JiYan_41_15": "Did the Riverside Games really get suspended? Can't we try to find another way?",
    "Character_JiYan_40_1": "We will be the winner! And we will be the record breaker! You hear me?",
    "Character_JiYan_40_2": "Yeah!",
    "Character_JiYan_40_3": "I can't hear you! LOUDER! DO YOU HEAR ME!",
    "Character_JiYan_40_4": "YEAH!!",
    "Character_JiYan_40_7": "A guest of Jinzhou! Thank you for rooting for us!",
    "Character_JiYan_40_8": "Apologies for being so loud. However, sometimes only a loud voice can show our determination to break the record. Don't you think so?",
    "Character_JiYan_40_9": "By the way, there was another team that was full of fight just like us, but it seems that they ran into some problem.",
    "Character_JiYan_40_10": "Wenshu rushed over there. Hope there's nothing wrong!",
    "Character_JiYan_40_11": "The race is about to start. We need to do a final warm-up. Don't miss our race!",
    "Character_JiYan_40_5": "LOUDER!!",
    "Character_JiYan_40_6": "Oh my!",
    "Character_JiYan_4_1": "{PlayerName}, what are you doing here? Have you found any event that you're interested in?",
    "Character_JiYan_4_3": "Trouble? If you're comfortable sharing, tell me about it. Maybe I can help.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_5": "So... you want me to join the relay as your temporary teammate?",
    "Character_JiYan_4_9": "Nothing.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_10": "No.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_11": "The key to winning a relay race lies in the mutual understanding, cooperation, and trust among team members.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_12": "Most of the teams are formed according to the Midnight Rangers units they belong to. Therefore, they're familiar with their teammates and have good teamwork.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_13": "I believe you can find a better candidate for your team. That candidate doesn't have to be me.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_16": "Disqualified due to insufficient participants... That's the rule. It'll be undoubtedly a great pity for them to quit without even putting up a fight.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_17": "Joining you... I see. It might be fun.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_18": "That being said, with a hastily assembled team like this, it may prove challenging to achieve the desired results.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_20": "A temporary team...",
    "Character_JiYan_4_22": "I am fine, thank you for asking... It's been a long time since I last heard that phrase.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_24": "Indeed. It's pointless to worry about the end result when you're not even part of the competition.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_25": "Yes... I see.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_26": "Spectators are gathering along the lanes. The race should start soon.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_27": "Let's go meet them first.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_28": "...",
    "Character_JiYan_4_30": "Nothing... Perhaps it's just my imagination.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_7": "What's the matter?",
    "Character_JiYan_4_2": "Yes, I have, but I've run into a bit of trouble.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_4": "Actually, I do need your help.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_6": "Exactly.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_8": "What, are you scared?",
    "Character_JiYan_4_14": "But we'll be disqualified if we can't find one more teammate before the relay starts.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_15": "I really want to join the race with you as my teammate.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_19": "As a temporary team, we just want a chance to participate. The result doesn't really matter to us.",
    "Character_JiYan_4_21": "You all right?",
    "Character_JiYan_4_29": "What's wrong?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_1": "You're the most skillful, so you go first. Rock the field and boost the morale. Put pressure on other teams. Disturb them!",
    "Character_JiYan_39_2": "Hmm... I don't think that's the best tactic. Remember the team ten years ago?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_3": "The record-breaker?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_4": "Yep, it's them. I heard that their strategy was to hide their true abilities in the first half and then have their last runner surpass the other contestants.",
    "Character_JiYan_39_5": "That's nonsense! What if we lag far behind in the first half and can't catch up in the second? All our efforts will be in vain!",
    "Character_JiYan_39_7": "Are you {PlayerName}? Are you going to participate in the Gulpuff Relay too?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_9": "Oh, you don't know that.",
    "Character_JiYan_39_10": "The Gulpuff Relay is the highlight of the team competitions in the Riverside Games. Each team consists of four members who control the Gulpuff Echo to race along the water lanes.",
    "Character_JiYan_39_11": "We're determining the relay order. Do you have any advice for us?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_12": "I'm the most skillful during the training. Changfeng and the other teammates have comparable speed and proficiency in controlling the Gulpuff. What do you think, should I run the first half or the second half?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_16": "See! {PlayerName} and I are on the same page! Decision's made.",
    "Character_JiYan_39_17": "Okay! I'm confident I can overtake them!",
    "Character_JiYan_39_18": "{PlayerName}, don't be silly! It's a relay! Anyway, thanks for your jest. It helped ease my nerves a bit.",
    "Character_JiYan_39_6": "What are you talking about?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_8": "What is the Gulpuff Relay?",
    "Character_JiYan_39_13": "The first half, be intimidating!",
    "Character_JiYan_39_14": "The second half, be the spotlight by overtaking in the last run.",
    "Character_JiYan_39_15": "Both.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_1": "Hi, {PlayerName}!",
    "Character_JiYan_38_2": "You know what!",
    "Character_JiYan_38_3": "I managed to borrow the video recording of the Riverside Games from ten years ago!",
    "Character_JiYan_38_5": "Yes, it had been unreturned.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_6": "The organizing committee is planning to hold another Riverside Games, so I wanted to check if it'd been returned.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_7": "And surprise! It had!",
    "Character_JiYan_38_8": "But I really have to say, the man that recorded this video sucked! All backs and no faces at all! I couldn't admire the daring and skill of the record holder.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_10": "What? When? Who is he?",
    "Character_JiYan_38_12": "Oh please, {PlayerName}, just tell me!",
    "Character_JiYan_38_13": "I really want to seek his advice...",
    "Character_JiYan_38_15": "Yes! Didn't expect that you still thought about it. Thanks, they've fully recovered.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_16": "Sorry, {PlayerName}...",
    "Character_JiYan_38_17": "I'm embarrassed to say that, but you know they're gonna organize another Riverside Games, right? Lingyan and I want to join the race with our former teammates.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_19": "Thank you, {PlayerName}! Promise you'll come watch us play!",
    "Character_JiYan_38_4": "Wasn't it borrowed by someone else?",
    "Character_JiYan_38_9": "You've already met him.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_11": "That's a secret.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_14": "How are your teammates? Have they recovered?",
    "Character_JiYan_38_18": "That's ok. I can understand your decision.",
    "Character_JiYan_38_20": "I promise.",
    "Character_JiYan_37_1": "Hi, {PlayerName}! It's the first time we've seen each other since the race, right?",
    "Character_JiYan_37_2": "Thank you so much for your help that day.",
    "Character_JiYan_37_4": "Though the race got suspended... being able to join the race with you and the general remains a cherished memory for me.",
    "Character_JiYan_37_5": "I heard that you and the general solved a big trouble together?",
    "Character_JiYan_37_6": "I really hope that I could be as capable as you are in the future...",
    "Character_JiYan_37_8": "Thank you for your kind words. I had always wanted to serve in the front line, but ended up in the Rearguard Camp. I may be stationed at the border in the future.",
    "Character_JiYan_37_9": "I don't want to give up my dream, so I'm still trying to apply for a transfer to the front line.",
    "Character_JiYan_37_11": "I know, but no matter how dangerous it is, somebody's got to do it. Whatever happens, as long as I have no regrets, that'll be worthwhile.",
    "Character_JiYan_37_12": "But of course, I'm gonna give my all to be a rearguard to protect people well before realizing my dream!",
    "Character_JiYan_37_13": "All right, I'm leaving for my duty. See ya!",
    "Character_JiYan_37_3": "You're welcome.",
    "Character_JiYan_37_7": "Of course you can!",
    "Character_JiYan_37_10": "It's dangerous in the front line.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_1": "Hello, {PlayerName}, there you are.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_3": "{PlayerName}, see? They're swimming so happily and freely.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_4": "But you know, happiness and freedom both come at a price.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_5": "Just sometimes, the price is borne by a small part of them.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_7": "Ten years... so long ago. If I remember, I was also in charge of the Riverside Games that year.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_8": "那年参赛队伍特别多，比赛一直持续到下午……那时的晚霞，正如同此刻，很美……很温馨。",
    "Character_JiYan_35_10": "那支小队是临时凑起来的，赛前大家都不看好他们，交接第一棒时还出现了失误。",
    "Character_JiYan_35_12": "但谁也没想到，最后一棒选手对咕咕河豚掌控自如，在终点弯道极限反超，实在是太精彩了。",
    "Character_JiYan_35_17": "Just like how excited you were in this photo.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_18": "If it hadn't been so urgent, we would have asked you to take a photo. Luckily, the photographer managed to capture this photo for you.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_20": "I should thank you for playing a big role in forming this team, {PlayerName}.",
    "Character_JiYan_35_22": "By the way, I'm going to discuss with Jiyan about the possibility of holding the Riverside Games again. If things go smoothly, I hope you can come and enjoy!",
    "Character_JiYan_35_6": "You know what happened to the temporary team ten years ago?",
    "Character_JiYan_35_19": "Thank you.",
    "Character_JiYan_34_1": "{PlayerName}, I heard that you're back to Jinzhou with Jiyan?",
    "Character_JiYan_34_2": "What a relief to see you both back safe and sound.",
    "Character_JiYan_34_3": "There's something I forgot to give you. If you have a moment, please come see me.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_1": "The fluctuation on the monitoring device have disappeared.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_2": "The potential outbreak of the Tacet Discord Tide seems to be under control.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_3": "As you requested, I compared this abnormal fluctuation with the spectrums of the Tacet Discord Tide, and I did find some similarities.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_4": "Thank you.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_5": "Hold on a second. I'm not finished.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_6": "Their spectrums aren't exactly the same. Sorry, I'm not the most specialized in this field, so it's difficult to draw any definite conclusions within such a limited time.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_7": "These are the frequency samples I recorded in the sphere.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_8": "I think it's better to hand the samples collected in the <ano=声之领域>Sonoro Sphere</ano> to that scholar.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_10": "白芷。<ano=声之领域>索诺拉</ano>属于回音学领域的研究，交给她负责会更高效准确。",
    "Character_JiYan_33_11": "Please keep them safe.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_12": "Hmm, are you concerned about how we handle the samples?",
    "Character_JiYan_33_13": "Don't get wrong. They just... mean a lot to me.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_14": "Rest assured. You should know how careful we are when handling research samples... especially ones as valuable as these.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_15": "This accident is a wake-up call for us. The Waveworn Phenomenon is much more complicated than we imagined.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_16": "It's a wake-up call, but it can also hold the key to uncovering the secrets of the Waveworn Phenomenon.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_17": "对了，组委会的人先前来过，他们应该是想找你商议一下，看看这届竞渡会是否有必要重新举办吧。",
    "Character_JiYan_33_18": "Sure, I'll go talk to them once everything is settled here.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_19": "{PlayerName}, there's a place I want to go to. If it's not too much trouble, could you accompany me?",
    "Character_JiYan_33_20": "Sure, let's go.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_21": "When you have time, come see me at the Knell Square. I'll be waiting for you.",
    "Character_JiYan_33_9": "That scholar?",
    "Character_JiYan_33_22": "Now, if there's nothing else, I'm going back to my lab.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_1": "Ugh... All those hours of training for nothing. We're doomed.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_2": "Don't give up yet. We've still got some time before the relay starts!",
    "Character_JiYan_3_4": "Hi, Wenshu! And this is...?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_5": "This is {PlayerName}.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_6": "Perfect timing! We're have a bit of a situation right now.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_8": "Two of our teammates accidentally injured themselves during warm-up... Luckily, the wounds weren't too bad, but the doctor said that they wouldn't be able to participate in the relay anytime soon.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_9": "We've asked the organizing committee. Said we can still participate with temporary teammates.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_10": "But the relay is starting soon. It's impossible to find another person to join us, not to mention two...",
    "Character_JiYan_3_11": "哎，队长前些天刚因家中急事退出，今天我们好不容易重新凑齐了队伍，谁知道又出了这档子事……",
    "Character_JiYan_3_12": "*sigh* Are we supposed to just wait for the next Riverside Games? Who knows when that will be...",
    "Character_JiYan_3_13": "Speaking of which... Do you have a team, {PlayerName}?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_15": "test/Oh, that reminds me... {PlayerName} is a Resonator too. <m>He's</m><f>She's</f> fully qualified for the Gulpuff Relay.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_16": "test/Still... it depends on whether <m>he></m><f>she</f> would like to join you.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_18": "The rules are simple! Four people form a team to take turns controlling a Gulpuff, passing it to the next person after a certain distance. The first team to reach the finish line wins.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_21": "Thank you so much! If we can get the prize money, we'll definitely split it with you!",
    "Character_JiYan_3_22": "Of course. Even if we don't rank, we'll treat you to a big feast well in Jinzhou to thank you for doing us such a big favor.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_23": "That's right! We'll buy you the best barbecue in Jinzhou. That place is everyone's favorite!",
    "Character_JiYan_3_24": "Then you're only one person short for the relay. Hmm, I know a good candidate for that...",
    "Character_JiYan_3_26": "Wh-who?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_28": "Bingo.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_29": "!!!",
    "Character_JiYan_3_30": "Oh! Why didn't I think of him!",
    "Character_JiYan_3_31": "Huh? Are you serious? The general doesn't look like he'd be interested in events like this.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_32": "Hehe... Well, all I can say is there's more to your general than you know.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_33": "What do you mean?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_34": "Instead of asking questions here, why don't you just go and invite him?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_35": "I don't have the guts...",
    "Character_JiYan_3_38": "Go invite him now, and you may still have a chance to get him onboard. Don't let others take your chance!",
    "Character_JiYan_3_39": "We're counting on you, {PlayerName}!",
    "Character_JiYan_3_3": "Lingyan, Ganquan, what's wrong?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_7": "What's the matter?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_14": "No.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_17": "What kind of competition is it, then?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_19": "Sounds interesting. Count me in.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_20": "What can I get out of this?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_25": "Are you talking about the person I'm thinking of?",
    "Character_JiYan_3_27": "Jiyan.",
    "Character_JiYan_3_36": "I'll go.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_1": "See? How lively! You really need to come and see it in person for the full effect.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_2": "And that's thanks to your efforts, Wenshu.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_3": "Well, I'm just doing my job. I should be the one thanking you. After all, without the Midnight Rangers tirelessly guarding the front lines, the <ano=sports games>Riverside Games</ano> wouldn't be possible.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_4": "Wenshu... Thank you, but you don't have to pitch me.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_5": "Why not? Go enjoy the youth! I would've rushed to sign up if I was still young.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_6": "{PlayerName}, it's good to see you here.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_7": "Oh! I guess you must be the Rover?",
    "Character_JiYan_2_8": "Nice to meet you! I'm the director of the Riverside Games. You can call me Wenshu.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_10": "Ah, I almost dropped the ball on this one. I would've forgotten to send out those invitations without Jiyan's reminder.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_11": "It's not worth mentioning, Wenshu. This is the first Riverside Games in many years, and you must have been busy with various matters. I only offered a little help when I could.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_12": "{PlayerName}, it's a slow day today. Please, take a break and have some fun.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_15": "That's right. Go participate in the event, you two! That's how you enjoy your day off!",
    "Character_JiYan_2_18": "Of course! The Jinzhou Riverside Games is an event for all people to enjoy. We always welcome guests to participate.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_19": "Indeed. I'm looking forward to your performance, {PlayerName}.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_20": "Only a few events specifically require participants to be Resonators. Other than that, there are no special restrictions for any event.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_21": "We haven't held the Riverside Games in years. Look at him, Jiyan still remembers the rules better than I do. Who would've thought?",
    "Character_JiYan_2_22": "During the preparation, I came across some pictures from past Games and instantly felt a rush of adrenaline. Ah, the memories of my youth...",
    "Character_JiYan_2_23": "It's a pity that the Midnight Rangers are always on the front lines, getting ready for emergencies. The Riverside Games is their only chance to relax and have some fun.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_26": "{PlayerName}, I suggest looking around for events to join if you're interested. Many of them are open to on-site registration.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_28": "Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to confirm the safety of the surrounding before the race begins... You can consult Wenshu should you need any assistance.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_29": "*sigh* I didn't invite him over for that. I asked him to come and relax, not to find a new place to work.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_30": "On the other hand, we couldn't have brought the situation at the borders under control without Jiyan's prudence...",
    "Character_JiYan_2_32": "Sorry, I'm getting off track. The Gulpuff Relay is about to start, and I have to go to the scene in case anything happens.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_33": "Especially those still warming up in the backup lane. Gotta bring them over.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_34": "{PlayerName}, are you coming with me?",
    "Character_JiYan_2_9": "Thank you for the invite, Wenshu.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_35": "Sure, why not.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_36": "Don't always be that tense. Sometimes, you do have to give yourself a breather. It's not good to push yourself too hard. So, how about picking up an event to participate in?",
    "Character_JiYan_2_38": "Have a great time, {PlayerName}.",
    "Character_JiYan_2_17": "You mean I can participate too?",
    "Character_JiYan_2_37": "Got it.",
    "Character_JiYan_15_1": "别总是紧绷着……都休假了……下次举办还不知道是什么时候……一起参加比赛吧……加油……加油……反超他……",
    "Character_JiYan_15_5": "Perhaps some people have been trapped in this place, or maybe...",
    "Character_JiYan_15_9": "这些残象……纠缠不休……别过来……我还……我还不想死……救救我……",
    "Character_JiYan_15_11": "These voices... They are...",
    "Character_JiYan_15_4": "It's the cheers during the Riverside Games, mingled together with cries for help.",
    "Character_JiYan_14_1": "The rain is getting worse. If this persists, we will likely have to face a small-scale Tacet Discord Outbreak.",
    "Character_JiYan_14_2": "{PlayerName}, I have your back. You can stay focused on analyzing the voices.",
    "Character_JiYan_13_1": "...Let's participate in... together...",
    "Character_JiYan_13_2": "H-help me...",
    "Character_JiYan_13_3": "The mumble is coming from here.",
    "Character_JiYan_13_4": "...I don't want...",
    "Character_JiYan_13_5": "These voices are trying to tell us something... We need to translate them into understandable information.",
    "Character_JiYan_12_1": "It's the Retroact Rain... We need to hurry up.",
    "Character_JiYan_11_1": "...Let's...",

    "Character_LingYang_8_1": "I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm the one you've been looking for. I have never ever made a lion dance request.",
    "Character_LingYang_8_2": "{PlayerName}, what brought you here?",
    "Character_LingYang_8_6": "I received a very private lion dance request before and the client wants me to hold a lion dance for a person alone.",
    "Character_LingYang_8_9": "That's not possible.",
    "Character_LingYang_8_11": "Please wait! There's one more question I'd like to ask.",

    "Character_LingYang_28_30": "But I did hear the bell...",
    "Character_LingYang_28_31": "Perhaps it's just your imagination? Maybe some Tacet Discords can mimic \"bells\"?",

    "Character_LingYang_28_12": "I'm so weak that I not only failed to find the \"Jingle Beast\"...",

    "Character_LingYang_17_13": "{PlayerName}, I didn't lie to you! There was a bell!",
    "Character_LingYang_17_15": "Well... thinking about how big it is, I don't think it's hidden in a cave like this. What do you say?",

    "Character_LingYang_17_27": "After we find him, we must let him explain the whole story!",
    "Character_LingYang_17_28": "You're right. His family is eager to know he's all right!",
    "Character_LingYang_17_29": "Of course! You have my word!",

    "Character_LingYang_17_4": "Did you hear the bell?",
    "Character_LingYang_17_5": "The \"Jingle Beast\" showed up.",
    "Character_LingYang_17_17": "If what they said is true, Beiji is probably at risk.",
    "Character_LingYang_17_18": "Shall we keep moving?",
    "Character_LingYang_17_22": "I know I wasn't supposed to ask you to come with us, but circumstances are dire and Beiji's in danger.",
    "Character_LingYang_17_23": "So I would like to ask you to come with me and help rescue Beiji as soon as possible. I would really appreciate your assistance!",

    "Character_LingYang_17_43": "Trust me.",
    "Character_LingYang_17_44": "Trust us.",

    "Character_LingYang_16_4": "Sorry Beishi... I stood between you and your dreams.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_5": "I-I don't expect forgiveness...",
    "Character_LingYang_16_6": "Perhaps, you're right... I-I-Your brother, is just a selfish coward.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_9": "Goodbye, Beishi. I'll kill the \"Jingle Beast\"... for you...",
    "Character_LingYang_16_10": "...(The video was interrupted here.)",
    "Character_LingYang_16_11": "It-it's my brother...",
    "Character_LingYang_16_13": "It's probably because I joined the Pioneer Association.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_14": "My brother was really against me joining the Pioneer Association.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_15": "But that was my dream, so I had an awful fight with him.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_17": "I don't know.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_19": "Eek!",
    "Character_LingYang_16_22": "No... It must be the \"Jingle Beast\"!",
    "Character_LingYang_16_23": "I know... I know this bell well.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_24": "A little while ago, when I was carrying out a mission in the wilderness, I was unexpectedly attacked by Tacet Discords.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_25": "When I could hardly run, I heard this bell.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_27": "I-I can't remember what happened after that... I was so frightened that my mind went completely blank.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_28": "I can only remember after hearing the bell, I...",
    "Character_LingYang_16_29": "I just kept running without looking back. That bell kept chasing me and only disappeared when I reached the safe zone.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_30": "If I hadn't made it, I would have been eaten by the \"Jingle Beast\".",
    "Character_LingYang_16_31": "So I'm not mistaken. It must be the \"Jingle Beast\"!",
    "Character_LingYang_16_34": "Alright, I'm going with you.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_2": "Let's try.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_12": "Why is he feeling guilty?",
    "Character_LingYang_16_16": "Why is he trying to kill the \"Jingle Beast\"?",
    "Character_LingYang_16_20": "Was it my imagination?",
    "Character_LingYang_16_21": "Nothing happened.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_26": "Then?",
    "Character_LingYang_16_32": "Don't worry. I'm with you.",
    "Character_LingYang_16_33": "Let's check it out.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_12": "This is just the tusk of an adult Sabyr Boar. It's indeed larger than the tusks of ordinary creatures.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_13": "It seems that they're using this to pretend that the \"Jingle Beast\" really exists.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_14": "It's been frozen for a while, but the inside has spoiled... Exactly like the stuff we found in the package.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_15": "I can smell the scent of chemicals.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_16": "Not only are they spreading rumors to upset people, but they even sell spoiled ingredients like this.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_19": "I'm pissed off, too.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_20": "The top priority now is to find clues about Beiji's whereabouts.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_21": "Meanwhile, we have one more issue to address. We need to follow \"The Savage Beasts\" to see what they're up to.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_22": "Based on their plan, their next victim is about to show up.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_25": "That sounds good to me. The Savage Beasts members are super alert, but I know the wilderness better than them. I'd be better at tracking them down.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_27": "{PlayerName}, I understand your anger.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_28": "But The Savage Beasts members are super alert. It'll be too risk for you to go alone. Besides, I know the wilderness better than them. It's probably more my place.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_29": "I want to ask you to search for Beiji alongside Beishi.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_30": "That'll be a relief to me if you two can do this together.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_33": "If anything happens, I'll \"call\" you.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_10": "(Show him \"The Tusk of an Unknown Creature\".)",
    "Character_LingYang_14_11": "(Show him \"The Frozen Meat\".)",
    "Character_LingYang_14_17": "It's unacceptable.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_18": "It's disgraceful!",
    "Character_LingYang_14_23": "I'll go look for Beiji.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_24": "I'll go look for The Savage Beasts.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_31": "Leave it to me.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_32": "I get it.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_35": "Thank you, {PlayerName}. You take care of yourself too.",
    "Character_LingYang_14_34": "Be safe.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_4": "We really found them...",
    "Character_LingYang_12_5": "Shhh... be careful.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_7": "According to their growth habit, they will never thrive in such an open place.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_8": "Therefore, they've been deliberately planted here. They may serve as warning devices or perhaps there are traps hidden underneath.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_9": "Let's say here and listen to what they're saying.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_10": "Well, among other things, the newcomer gets things done quickly.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_11": "Too nosy, startin' talkin' 'bout the \"Jingle Beast\" the second he came.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_12": "If he's that eager to find the \"Jingle Beast\", let him have a go at it.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_13": "He's gotta fend for himself.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_15": "Boss, word has it that the guy we're gonna deal with is rather tough.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_16": "He probably won't buy into the \"Jingle Beast\" rumor.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_17": "Really?",
    "Character_LingYang_12_19": "You get what I'm sayin' now?",
    "Character_LingYang_12_20": "Brilliant! Boss, you're so relentless!",
    "Character_LingYang_12_21": "Young, too young.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_22": "You're just a pup. Don't get what really gives folks the jitters..",
    "Character_LingYang_12_23": "Anyway, I'll go with ya this time.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_24": "Folks, let's go! Grab your bits!",
    "Character_LingYang_12_26": "*exhale* Are they gone?",
    "Character_LingYang_12_27": "No, wait. They haven't gone far.",
    "Character_LingYang_12_29": "I can still hear their breathing.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_1": "*sigh of relief* Thank you. Thank you for coming in time.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_2": "Are you alright?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_3": "Thank you for asking. I'm fine. I could have run away, but... in that case, the owners of these packages would never receive them.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_6": "TEST/ Of course! The slogan of our Lollo Logistics is \"We Promise, We Deliver\"!",
    "Character_LingYang_10_7": "All goods need to be transferred from here, but I rarely see someone send a package directly through us. If they do, I will surely remember them.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_8": "We're looking for a missing sender, so we're hoping to get some information from you.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_9": "Thank you for saving my life. I'll answer your questions as candidly as I can!",
    "Character_LingYang_10_10": "Does this package look familiar?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_11": "Hmm, I'm sorry, but it doesn't ring any bell...",
    "Character_LingYang_10_12": "But we checked the entire delivery process of this package and it shows that the package was sent through you.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_13": "...Maybe it's a mistake?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_14": "I see... Well, let's move on to another question.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_17": "The \"Tingle Beast\"? Isn't it the monster that's been going viral recently?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_18": "You mean the \"Jingle Beast\", right?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_19": "That's not the point. How we call it doesn't change the fact that it's a brutal beast.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_20": "It's said that it has long tusks and its sharp claws can easily tear any prey to shreds.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_21": "However, an Exile group called \"The Savage Beasts\" is said to be able to communicate with it.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_22": "Therefore, residents are paying them to let them talk the \"Jingle Beast\" out of messing around.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_23": "\"The Savage Beasts\"... It sounds familiar.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_24": "Do you know the \"Tingle Beast\"? The monster that's been going viral recently.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_25": "You mean the \"Jingle Beast\", right?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_26": "That's not the point. How we call it doesn't change the fact that it's a brutal beast.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_27": "It's said that they know how to communicate with that ferocious \"Jingle Beast\".",
    "Character_LingYang_10_28": "Therefore, residents are paying them to let them talk the \"Jingle Beast\" out of messing around.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_29": "That's all I know, sir.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_30": "Thank you, but I've got one last question.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_31": "Do you know where we can find \"The Savage Beasts\" or the \"Jingle Beast\"?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_32": "...I'm sorry I have my work ethic to follow. I cannot divulge details of our clients.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_33": "But I've heard that the \"Jingle Beast\" is often found in a campground near a broken tree on the mountainside.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_34": "It's often seen on the guard tower as well.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_35": "I see. Thank you for answering my questions.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_38": "Sir, may I remind you...",
    "Character_LingYang_10_39": "That beast is very dangerous... beyond your wildest imagination. Please be careful.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_40": "And there may be more than one \"Jingle Beast\".",
    "Character_LingYang_10_41": "I got it! Rest assured!",
    "Character_LingYang_10_43": "*sigh* There is no useful information...",
    "Character_LingYang_10_45": "Now we know that \"The Savage Beasts\" is deeply linked with the \"Jingle Beast\".",
    "Character_LingYang_10_46": "Besides, did you notice his expression?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_47": "Apparently, he was frightened so that he didn't dare to tell us some information.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_50": "At least, he provided clues for us. We now know where we can find the \"Jingle Beast\".",
    "Character_LingYang_10_51": "But-but there are so many camp sites in the wild, how can we locate the \"Jingle Beast\" with such an ambiguous answer?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_52": "Follow me and keep your eyes open along the way.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_4": "I pay tribute to your professionalism.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_5": "Does anyone often send packages from here?",
    "Character_LingYang_10_15": "It's about the \"Jingle Beast\".",
    "Character_LingYang_10_16": "It's about \"The Savage Beasts\".",
    "Character_LingYang_10_44": "Not exactly.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_48": "He had been threatened.",
    "Character_LingYang_10_49": "He felt guilty.",
    "Character_LingYang_1_32": "What are you doing here?",
    "Character_LingYang_1_33": "Tomorrow night, the Liondance Troupe is gonna do a grand lion dance show, and I'm now advertising it!",
    "Character_LingYang_1_34": "The Liondance Troupe?",
    "Character_LingYang_1_35": "The lion dance show?",
    "Character_LingYang_1_38": "Well, lion dance is a traditional custom in Jinzhou.",
    "Character_LingYang_1_39": "It's usually performed by troupes specializing in lion dance performances, just like the Liondance Troupe I'm in.",
    "Character_LingYang_1_40": "As for Jinzhou's folklore activities, there are so many I wanna tell you!",
    "Character_LingYang_1_41": "Stomach growls...",
    "Character_LingYang_1_42": "Oh, I'm so embarrassed... Sorry, I feel a bit hungry after rehearsing for a whole day.",
    "Character_LingYang_1_43": "How about I buy you a meal? Let's talk over eating. That's the point!",
    "Character_LingYang_1_44": "That's a thing?",
    "Character_LingYang_1_45": "You're too kind...",
    "Character_LingYang_1_46": "What do you want from me?",
    "Character_LingYang_1_49": "Don't take me wrong. It's just how Jinzhou people treat their guests.",
    "Character_LingYang_1_36": "The Liondance Troupe is a parade troupe that specializes in lion dance performances.",
    "Character_LingYang_1_37": "And lion dance is a traditional custom in Jinzhou.",

    "HuanglongXZ_9_1": "What's wrong? Are you injured from the fight?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_4": "You saw our Sentinel in your memories?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_6": "Yeah, the one we built this statue for. The <ano=Oracle Engine>Sentinel</ano> in Jinzhou. There are one court and six cities in Jinzhou, with each city having its own Sentinel. While they share some similarities in appearance, there are also differences.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_10": "Sentinels are present where civilization and history thrive. Huanglong stands out with the highest number of currently coexisting Sentinels, because of its long history and vast land.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_11": "Records state the Sentinels in Huanglong were once a single entity. Now they are each responsible for a part of Huanglong.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_12": "Naturally, there are Sentinels in other regions too, but far fewer compared to Huanglong.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_13": "In Huanglong, most of the Sentinels take the shape of a <ano=dragon>Loong</ano>. In other regions, they manifest in various forms, some are even... beyond our imagination.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_14": "You were standing face to face with our Sentinel?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_15": "One can hardly see our Sentinel with their own eyes. Most people only get the chance during the Appointment Ceremonies.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_16": "According to your description, you stood pretty close. Normally, only the Sentinel's Appointed Resonator is allowed in its proximity; currently, that person is the <ano=highest official>Magistrate</ano> of Jinzhou...",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_19": "Whoa! Darn... That must be an Elite Class!",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_2": "I think I remembered something.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_3": "What is this statue?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_5": "Sentinel?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_7": "Are there other Sentinels outside Huanglong?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_8": "What do the other Sentinels look like?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_9": "I saw myself standing face to face with it.",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_17": "Perhaps it's just my imagination?",
    "HuanglongXZ_9_18": "...",
    "HuanglongXZ_8_1": "Bravo! So you still remember how to fight despite having forgotten everything, wow.",
    "HuanglongXZ_8_2": "Watch me lead the charge next time! No one messes with Ma Xiaofa... Ahem, I mean Chixia!",
    "HuanglongXZ_7_1": "It may seem all nice and quiet here now, but you never know when a Tacet Discord might pop up outta nowhere!",
    "HuanglongXZ_7_2": "Oh my, \"speak of the devil\".",
    "HuanglongXZ_6_1": "Rover, I know you can't remember a thing, but there's one thing I'm 90%... no, 100% sure about you! You must be a Resonator too.",
    "HuanglongXZ_6_2": "You've got a Tacet Mark on the back of your hand, and you have a <ano=Terminal>gourd</ano>. These are proofs you're a Resonator. Your gourd's design looks a bit different from the ones we use though.",
    "HuanglongXZ_6_3": "Plus, not many people's gonna hang out in the wilderness these days, unless they're Resonators.",
    "HuanglongXZ_5_1": "The \"Etheric Sea\" I just mentioned is a special type of abnormal weather phenomenon. The sky appears to resemble an upside-down ocean surface.",
    "HuanglongXZ_5_2": "These \"Tacet Fields\" are places where <ano=Reverberations>Tacet Discords</ano> materialize and gather. The closer you get to one in the wild, the more dangerous it becomes.",
    "HuanglongXZ_5_3": "However, the formation of Tacet Fields is unpredictable. For now, we only know that Etheric Sea indicates the imminent formation of a Tacet Field.",
    "HuanglongXZ_5_4": "Also, we have <color=Highlight>Resonators</color> who can detect the formation of Tacet Fields nearby, like what Yangyang just did. She can tell all kinds of information by reading the Streams in the wind—that's her Resonance Ability.",
    "HuanglongXZ_5_5": "—while I couldn't feel a thing, haha.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_1": "Are you alright? Do you feel any discomfort?",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_5": "You can call me Chixia... And, she's Yangyang!",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_6": "We are in the Gorges of Spirits. It's on the outskirts of Jinzhou, Huanglong.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_7": "Your attire doesn't seem local. Are you a roving traveler from afar, or... someone returning home?",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_11": "So you don't know why you're here, where you're from, or who you are...",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_12": "Baizhi didn't tell us you'd have these aftereffects when you wake up.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_14": "The wind has brought us a warning. The Etheric Sea is converging. It seems a new Tacet Field is taking shape.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_16": "That means it's probably gonna get dangerous here soon.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_17": "Ugh, I knew it. Our <ano=Terminals>gourds</ano> are out of service because of the Etheric Sea's influence. We can't send or receive messages for help now. We better hurry over to meet up with Baizhi at our gathering spot and get outta here.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_18": "Guess you really can't recall a thing, but don't worry!",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_22": "We shouldn't stay here. If you don't have other plans, how about leaving with us for now?",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_25": "Oh, that's great! Let's go together!",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_26": "The terrain is complicated here, and we usually take that one route. If you don't mind, why don't we travel together for now? You can decide your future plans once we leave the gorge.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_27": "Yeah, let's get going!",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_2": "You are?",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_8": "...Rover?",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_9": "I don't remember.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_15": "What do you mean?",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_19": "Rover... can we call you that before you can remember your true name?",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_20": "You can call me that for now.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_21": "It suits me.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_23": "Alright.",
    "HuanglongXZ_4_24": "Is there only one way out of the gorge?",
    "HuanglongXZ_3_1": "...You're awake.",
    "HuanglongXZ_3_2": "Let me see! Let me see!",
    "HuanglongXZ_3_3": "Thank goodness you're awake! Or I'll have to try my last-ditch move—Emergency Skills for Junior Patrollers, Lesson One: CPR!",
    "HuanglongXZ_3_4": "Erm, never did it on any living person though.",
    "HuanglongXZ_3_5": "...Chixia.",
    "HuanglongXZ_25_1": "Can you reenact what you did before?",
    "HuanglongXZ_25_5": "Hmm, maybe you can only absorb the powerful ones with your body?",
    "HuanglongXZ_25_6": "Or does it have to be a certain type of Tacet Discord?",
    "HuanglongXZ_25_7": "Or maybe...",
    "HuanglongXZ_25_2": "(Shake your head.)",
    "HuanglongXZ_25_3": "I feel nothing.",
    "HuanglongXZ_25_4": "I don't have the feeling of being pushed like I did before.",
    "HuanglongXZ_24_1": "I'm gonna get you one you can absorb. I never go back on my promise! Your hero Chixia's on the hunt!",
    "HuanglongXZ_24_2": "Over there!",
    "HuanglongXZ_23_1": "It would be best for your well-being to have a thorough physical examination once we arrive in Jinzhou.",
    "HuanglongXZ_23_2": "While there don't seem to be any immediate side effects following the absorption of that Echo, we cannot rule out the possibility of other latent risks.",
    "HuanglongXZ_23_3": "Given our lack of data on you and your unusual physical signs, I suggest absorbing another Reverberation with your Terminal when we find one. That being said, please be sure to proceed cautiously.",
    "HuanglongXZ_23_4": "Yeah, don't go too hard on yourself. You should get a check-up just to be safe. Besides, Yangyang's very worried about you.",
    "HuanglongXZ_23_5": "If you feel any discomfort along the way, please do let us know.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_2": "Wait? The signal's back!",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_3": "This is... a holographic message to the entire Jinzhou from the City Hall.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_5": "My fellow soldiers and citizens, I apologize for any inconvenience caused. I am Jinhsi, the Magistrate of Jinzhou.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_6": "As the <color=Highlight>Moon-chasing Festival</color> approaches, our city welcomes visitors from around the world. The festivities are highly anticipated by our people, and I, too, share in this joyful sentiment.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_7": "Jinzhou has always been a crucial defense against Tacet Discord Outbreaks, safeguarding Huanglong. We have a heavy responsibility on our shoulders with no room for retreat or failure.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_8": "It is the dedication of our warriors, along with the diligence of our citizens, that has allowed us to thrive in peace and prosperity.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_9": "Despite the challenges of Tacet Discords, we remain steadfast and hospitable to visitors, upholding our enduring traditions.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_10": "With that in mind, I have a favor to ask.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_11": "Among our many visitors, there is one <color=Highlight>visitor</color> that holds utmost importance to me, the City of Jinzhou, and the entirety of Huanglong.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_12": "We have awaited your arrival for a long time.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_14": "Given the circumstances, you may be feeling bewildered at this time.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_15": "You should have noticed some strange happenings related to you.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_16": "If you plan to stay in Jinzhou for some time, I would be more than delighted to personally meet you in the City Hall of Jinzhou.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_17": "While I cannot guarantee to provide all the answers you need, I will do my best to assist you and provide necessary permissions, if applicable.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_18": "This is only my personal request. You can decide your course of action in any way you see fit.",
    "HuanglongXZ_21_19": "Therefore, I request the people and soldiers of Jinzhou to assist this esteemed visitor when the opportunity arises.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_1": "What... What kinda power is that!",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_2": "Rover, you...",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_3": "You been playin' the fool all along?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_4": "I've never seen a Resonance Ability quite like this. You got any other tricks up your sleeve? Like, eating a whole Tacet Discord? Grilling Echoes alive?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_9": "Wasn't it your Resonance Ability?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_10": "Could it be related to your lost memories? Can you recall anything now?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_11": "Indeed. So what would a Tacet Discord taste like? Spicy? Sweet?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_12": "I heard some folks tried to cook Gulpuffs, and they even made it a local speciality, didn't they?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_13": "Speaking of which, Gulpuff's a type of Tacet Discord, too!",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_14": "I'm even more curious now... Anyway, spicy food is always the best!",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_17": "Rover, are you feeling alright? Any discomfort?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_18": "Could it be the side effect of fighting that Tacet Discord? Baizhi, can we take Rover to do a check-up at Huaxu Academy's Resonance Medical Department...",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_21": "Baizhi?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_22": "Absorbing Echoes with the human body is not entirely unprecedented.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_23": "With the human body...?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_24": "I remember <i>Comprehensive Mirror for Historians</i> mentioned this in the Huanglong section's opening...",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_25": "“... A celestial being descended, commanding the <ano=universe>Qiankun's</ano> boundless power. Assuming mortal form, they condensed the primordial essence, creating Pangu. Cleaving heaven and earth apart, they aligned the celestial and terrestrial. Their radiance encompassed the four corners. Thus began the illustrious annals of Huanglong, as provinces were first demarcated...\"",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_29": "There was a very strong person way back. Like they held the whole universe right in their hands. As there was no Terminal in those days, they absorbed the Tacet Discords with their bare hands!",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_30": "and the TD they absorbed was the most powerful of all. That person turned it into the first Echo ever.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_34": "Actually... I'm not, I hope I was though. That was just some old tales my parents used to tell me, kinda like the <i>Sentinel's Appointment</i> thing.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_35": "Yangyang's got impressive memories for the ancient texts. Me? I just happen to roughly remember what the story's about.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_36": "Please, Yangyang, stop reciting that! I'm beggin' you!",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_37": "Oh my, it's takin' me back to my school days, when I had to recite pages and pages of them... Anyway, that's just a made-up legend, isn't it?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_38": "Come on, that was eons ago. Us Resonators do live a little longer, but we're still looking at 'bout a hundred years or so. And the known history of Huanglong stretches back at least a thousand years...",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_39": "If I may say, Rover, you seem quite \"mysterious\", too.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_40": "That's where the names \"Pangu Terminal\" and \"Qiankun Data Bank\" come from.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_41": "Whether it's true or not, that story happened a long time ago when Jinzhou didn't even exist.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_42": "Could it be that Rover's like, the great-great-great-great-great-{Male=granddaddy;Female=granny} of us all?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_43": "Let's not jump to conclusions without enough data and proper analysis.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_44": "Rover.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_5": "That wasn't my Resonance Ability.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_6": "I have no idea what happened.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_7": "It's not that different from eating it alive.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_8": "How does that relate to my cooking skills...?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_19": "I'm fine.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_20": "Yeah, I need a check-up.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_26": "What does that mean?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_27": "That sounds mysterious.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_28": "Pangu? Qiankun?",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_31": "Chixia, you must know a lot about history.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_32": "I see.",
    "HuanglongXZ_20_33": "What if I am that person...",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_1": "Yangyang! Rover!",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_2": "Are you alright? Are you hurt?",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_3": "(Shake your head.)",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_4": "I have never seen such a formidable Tacet Discord before, but Rover was able to completely defeat it.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_9": "I... didn't really do much. It was all thanks to you, Rover.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_10": "Rover, what was that last move called? That looked as cool as Fiamma's killer move!",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_11": "Aww c'mon, stop being modest! So you didn't even go all out earlier. I saw how you took down that fella with both of my eyes!",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_12": "You made a couple kicks and that thing vanished into thin air!",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_14": "That's strange. The Gorges of Spirits isn't known to be so dangerous...",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_15": "Anyway, come check this out!",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_18": "Wow! An Echo of the Elite Class... Someone got lucky today!",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_19": "My apologies. We got a little carried away. Does \"Reverberation\" or \"Echo\" ring a bell to you, Rover?",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_20": "Everything in our world is made up of frequencies, and every sound generates a reverberation.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_21": "Those \"Echoes\" are the lingering Reverberations of Tacet Discords after they disintegrate. We can absorb them into the Data Banks in our Pangu Terminals.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_22": "Oh, by Pangu Terminal, she means the gourd-shaped device every Resonator has, developed by researchers in Huanglong!",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_23": "But you see, it's not always we get to find these. Also, there's a limit to what your gourd can absorb.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_24": "Absorption is only possible when your Data Bank's level is equal to or higher than the Tacet Discord's level. The Terminal can then convert its Reverberation into an \"Echo\" for use in battle.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_25": "My Terminal issued a warning when it detected that Tacet Discord earlier. It should be at least an Overlord Class.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_26": "Rover, would you mind checking your Data Bank level?",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_27": "No need for that! Rover, why don't you just try absorbing it with your Terminal?",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_28": "...Oh. So it doesn't work.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_32": "There should be some sweet Baby Roseshrooms 'round here. Let's go check those out, shall we?",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_33": "It won't take long before the Reverberations disappear and the Etheric Sea vanishes. Once that happens, the Resonance Beacon signals will come back.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_34": "The Tacet Field will dissipate, biding time for its next resurgence.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_35": "We'll need to report the unusual phenomena here to the City Hall and the Academy.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_36": "Let's make our exit.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_5": "We beat it together.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_6": "A piece of cake.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_7": "It's a hard-won battle.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_16": "An illusion... left by the Tacet Discord?",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_17": "What is this?",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_29": "It says I'm on Level 0.",
    "HuanglongXZ_18_30": "What will happen if I can't absorb it?",
    "HuanglongXZ_17_1": "Yangyang! Rover!",
    "HuanglongXZ_17_2": "Where are you?",
    "HuanglongXZ_17_3": "We're blocked outside. We can't get in. Are you alright?",
    "HuanglongXZ_17_4": "Rover is with me. And... that strange Tacet Discord is here too.",
    "HuanglongXZ_17_5": "It's the Tacet Discord's ability.",
    "HuanglongXZ_17_6": "...Be careful.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_1": "Once we're outta the gorge, there's only a short walk to reach Jinzhou!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_2": "Jinzhou is the safest place round here. The Resonance Nexus provides coverage for the whole city. Besides, we've got a protective barrier and strong fortifications!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_5": "Hehe, right?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_6": "Hehe, maybe it's not as big as some other cities. BUT! Jinzhou is always the best place in my heart!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_7": "Jinzhou sits right between the Desorock Highland and the Norfall Barrens. It is a border city as well as a fortress. Therefore, it is referred to as the throat of Huanglong.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_8": "Huh? We've agreed to meet up with Baizhi here... Where is she?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_9": "This is the center of the Etheric Sea.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_11": "...A Tacet Field?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_12": "...When did it show up?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_13": "It wasn't here when we just got here.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_15": "But I didn't sense a hint of a Tacet Field's presence...",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_16": "So it appeared while we weren't looking? Like, in the blink of an eye?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_17": "Or maybe the Etheric Sea can tell where we are? Could it be following us?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_19": "The center of this Tacet Field...",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_22": "Isn't that Baizhi?!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_23": "Baizhi!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_24": "BAIZHI!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_25": "We are too far apart. Perhaps she can't hear us...",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_28": "Freshly formed Tacet Fields have a Dormant period. During this time, it is relatively safe.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_31": "My apologies. I should have said it is \"temporary\" safe.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_32": "The Dormant period of a Tacet Field varies based on its formation time. Generally, the shorter the formation time, the longer the Dormant period. However, with a longer Dormant period, the Tacet Discords born within are usually stronger.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_33": "We agreed to meet up 'round here, and she said she was off to collect some samples. Gosh, did she really go straight into the heart of a Tacet Field for that?!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_34": "Baizhi wouldn't take such risks without careful consideration. Freshly formed Tacet Fields goes through a Dormant period.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_38": "Accordin' to the <ano=Popular Shows in Jinzhou>Hero Plays</ano>, Yes! There's a chance for that!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_39": "True, who could've set the bait, then?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_40": "You.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_44": "Oh, I see... the one who seems simple-minded in the group is actually the mastermind with schemes. That's another popular trope!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_45": "No, wait... I'm not the mastermind!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_46": "...Rover.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_47": "Oh, I see... the one who seems gentle and quiet is actually the villain, hiding right under the protagonist's nose. That's a common trope, too!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_48": "No, wait... Yangyang isn't the villain!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_49": "Well, that's not impossible, though...",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_50": "What?!",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_52": "Some Tacet Discords can parrot human speech and behavior, namely the Whisperins. I doubt whether they can imitate a real person to this extent, though...",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_3": "Sounds impressive.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_4": "Not bad.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_20": "Something is there.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_21": "Someone is there.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_26": "Isn't the Tacet Field dangerous?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_27": "Why is she there?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_29": "During this time?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_30": "You mean this Tacet Field is relatively \"safe\" now?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_35": "Hopefully we won't bump right into Tacet Discords as soon as we get there.",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_36": "Is there any chance that Baizhi down there is a bait?",
    "HuanglongXZ_13_37": "Let's go down then.",
    "HuanglongXZ_12_1": "We are almost at the gorge's entrance. There will be a descent, but if your Terminal's Glider module still works, it will make things easier.",
    "HuanglongXZ_12_2": "I will show you how to use it.",
    "HuanglongXZ_11_1": "See? There's a Resonance Beacon over there.",
    "HuanglongXZ_11_2": "When you see a Beacon, be sure to register and activate it. It's usually safe within a 5 meters radius of a Beacon. It can protect you from danger sometimes.",
    "HuanglongXZ_11_3": "Rover, could you hand me your Terminal for a moment?",
    "HuanglongXZ_11_4": "Done. Its design and system version are different from ours, but your Terminal still has the data transfer and other basic functions.",
    "HuanglongXZ_10_1": "That was close! You fought so well!",

    "HuanglongM1_1_7_15": "So this is the true confidence of our Rover!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_16": "I agree though. So far, you've been ticking all the boxes in our Magistrate's description.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_17": "There is a small chance she's not in the City Hall, but it is very unlikely for her to not be in Jinzhou.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_18": "Or rather, it's nearly impossible for the Magistrate to leave Jinzhou at all.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_19": "With her busy schedule, it's already difficult to find any time off. In addition, as the Magistrate of Jinzhou, leaving the land under her jurisdiction without authentication is not allowed.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_20": "Unless she's engaged on a duty travel, or... when Jinzhou's safety is under threat.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_21": "Yup, there's gotta be something big if that's the case!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_23": "Sure they can.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_24": "Have you thought of something, Rover?",

    "HuanglongM1_1_7_33": "I can't really keep up with your thoughts, but I think a meeting with the Magistrate wouldn't hurt.",

    "HuanglongM1_1_7_44": "VIP or not VIP, special or not special... That doesn't matter at all.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_45": "...unless there's money to earn, of course!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_46": "Then that's exactly what we're after!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_47": "We're on the right track then! You'll be getting your memories back in no time.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_48": "What do you think, Rover? Are you in a hurry to recover your memories?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_53": "Would you let us join you, Rover, whether you want to recover old memories... or create new ones?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_54": "That said, it's time for your meeting with the Magistrate.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_55": "We are not allowed to go with you. Chixia and I will be right outside the City Hall.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_56": "We'll be waiting for you.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_57": "That's right, we're not going anywhere! Just give us a shout if anything goes down—Wait, no, we won't be able to hear ya. Plus they've got this rule about not yelling inside the City Hall.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_3": "Are they all here for an audience with the Magistrate?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_5": "Turned down by who?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_6": "It's me they're waiting for.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_7": "Perhaps the Magistrate is not here yet.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_11": "Who's Sanhua?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_22": "Can holographic messages be prerecorded?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_25": "Perhaps the Magistrate did not know who her guest was.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_26": "I'm wondering why the Magistrate wanted to meet her guest in person.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_27": "There must be more to it for her to purposefully attract so much attention.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_29": "She didn't do so just because her guest might be \"confused\".",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_30": "She should have anticipated the follow-up of her public message.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_31": "Still, how does she decide who is her guest, and who is not...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_32": "Nothing.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_35": "I believe so.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_36": "What do you think?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_37": "What if I am not the guest?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_38": "What if I am the guest?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_49": "Most certainly.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_50": "The loss of memory doesn't bother me.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_51": "I don't know what to do.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_7_52": "What really matters is how I'll live my life and create new memories.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_1": "What do you mean I'm not the VIP the Magistrate's expecting. Go see for yourself, everyone's been talking about it!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_2": "\"Every guest is important to Jinzhou!\"",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_3": "They didn't tell me I'm not!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_4": "Why can't you let me talk to the Magistrate?!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_5": "How far did you get? Did you manage to see the Magistrate?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_6": "I got to see... Lady Sanhua! She even looked back at me!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_7": "And I even got Lady Sanhua's verbal assurance... That I wasn't the guest the Magistrate was waiting for!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_8": "But who cares anyway.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_6_9": "I was able to witness Lady Sanhua in the flesh and be rejected by her in person!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_5_1": "I have the arrangements in place. Rover, you can come visit the Magistrate at any time.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_5_2": "Chixia, do you mind bringing Rover over to the City Hall?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_3_1": "Here we are. Jinzhou's Nexus Tower!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_3_3": "Exactly. Lemme see, uh, think of it as Jinzhou's largest server station, or an integration hub. It's something along those lines. I'm not much of a tech person myself.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_3_4": "Long story short, it's a navigator, a defense system, and a regional information center all in one enormous package.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_3_5": "The smaller ones we ran into earlier are Resonance Beacons.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_3_6": "Data is shared between all Beacons. You activate one, and the entire map's data will be relayed to your Terminal. Pretty nifty, huh?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_3_7": "Just place your Terminal here.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_3_2": "The Nexus Tower?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_1": "Rover!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_2": "It took you so long. What gives? Was our Magistrate a chatterbox?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_3": "You told Chixia and Yangyang about your conversation with Sanhua.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_4": "So Madam Magistrate's not in the City Hall...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_5": "...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_8": "The wind is rising. In it, I sense disturbance and unrest.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_9": "Hahaha. It sure is.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_10": "...Chixia.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_11": "The increasing Tacet Fields, uncannily powerful Tacet Discords, and now, our Magistrate's absence...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_12": "Plus... The mysterious Rover!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_13": "I'm afraid...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_18": "Welp, we've reported to the City Hall, the Ministry of War, AND the Academy. We've done everything we can.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_19": "I mean, this is Huanglong! And we're talking about Jinzhou, of all places! We've been through our fair share of unrest over the past thousand years, and we've made it together every time.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_20": "There's been TD outbreaks every year, but we can always trust General Jiyan, Madam Magistrate, and our Sentinel to have our backs! We're not ones to mess with.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_21": "\"United we stand, a bastion of might; one equals a legion, invulnerable in fight\"... Well said, Chixia.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_22": "Yeah! We've reported to the City Hall, the Ministry of War, AND the Academy. We've done everything we can so far.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_23": "I mean, this is Huanglong! And we're talking about Jinzhou of all places. It's never actually been safe here over the past thousands of years. We made it through all those TD outbreaks anyway.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_24": "We can always trust General Jiyan, Madam Magistrate, and our Sentinel to have our backs! We're not ones to mess with.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_25": "Well said.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_26": "Aren't you the practical type!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_27": "I'd love me some Chili Sauce Tofu, Jinzhou Maocai, Spicy Meat Slices... Ugh, I'm starving. Wait a sec, we still need to meet up with Baizhi first, right?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_28": "So Madam Magistrate is meeting you in three days, and she left these tokens for you, said you can look into what they represent while she is away...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_29": "Do you have any plans, Rover?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_6": "What's the matter?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_7": "Why the long face?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_14": "Jinzhou might be in danger.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_15": "There's no need to worry.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_16": "Before that, what should we get for dinner?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_17": "What should we do next?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_30": "I don't think there's much for me to do.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_31": "Let's investigate the items.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_10_1": "You heard the crisp sounds of Weiqi pieces being laid down on the board, followed by a long silence.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_10_4": "There was no response. Maybe those inside are too invested in their game of Weiqi.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_10_5": "The door didn't bulge.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_10_2": "(Knock on the door.)",
    "HuanglongM1_1_10_3": "(Push the door.)",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_1": "Alrighty. What should we do next?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_2": "Shall we go grab a bite?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_7": "I am to return to the Academy.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_8": "The anomalies at the Gorges of Spirits, the resurgence of that Tacet Field, and the many Waveworn Phenomena occurrences... I should report them in time.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_9": "Then I'll go submit our report, and prepare the documentation needed for Rover's audience with the Magistrate while I'm there.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_14": "It's the political hub of Jinzhou, and where the <ano=Data Repository>Grand Library</ano> is located.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_15": "The City Hall is an important place. Seeking an audience with the Magistrate isn't too difficult, but there are still rules to follow.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_16": "It may take some time, but there won't be too much paperwork.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_17": "Then I guess I'll take Rover over to the Nexus Tower for registration first, and we'll just hang out for a while.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_18": "Being new to Jinzhou and all, {Male=he;Female=she} can't be left standing outside the City Hall with nothing to do.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_19": "Hospitality is our local speciality, you know!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_20": "Then I'll leave you in Chixia's care, Rover. Is that alright with you? I'll give you a call once the paperwork is done.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_21": "Leave it to me!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_22": "I'll send the Branch of Resonmedical Science a notice. We need to conduct a throughout physical examination on you to make sure you are fine.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_23": "Come visit the Academy after your audience if you have no other plans.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_27": "Yes. A physical examination would be required to determine if any disease is present. If no medical issues are found, we'll conduct further monitoring and analysis to understand what happened to your body.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_28": "Of course, we won't do anything without your consent.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_29": "The unique nature of your condition requires specialized treatment only available in the Huaxu Academy.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_30": "And your body is bound to arouse the interest of many researchers.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_31": "Myself included.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_32": "Baizhi, I think your last sentence could be worded better...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_33": "I see. I agree that my phrasing lacked the attention to detail. Please allow me to reorganize my words.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_34": "You guys done yet?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_35": "What's the hold up. Let's move, then I'll have more time to show Rover around!",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_36": "We've got loads of fun in Jinzhou! We can go watch Liondances, Hero Plays, Stand-up Shows, and then maybe the Martial Championships... Plus tons of different treats to try out. You think it, we have it.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_3": "Sounds good.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_4": "We should visit the City Hall.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_5": "I should go get my body check-up.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_6": "Let's focus on the task at hand.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_10": "Documentation?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_11": "Sounds like a lot of work.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_12": "What about me?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_13": "Very well.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_24": "A throughout examination?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_25": "The Academy?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_1_26": "Sure.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_9_3": "Let me cut to the chase: it's hollow. You can even hear the echo when you gently tap its case.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_9_4": "Moreover, it's not just a timekeeping tool; it's an intricate mortise-and-tenon puzzle box.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_9_5": "This sundial is hollow with an inner compartment. Through equipment scanning, I found a small paper scroll inside this compartment.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_9_6": "However, it's missing a crucial component.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_9_7": "If we can find the right part and install it, the two-wheel disc structure on the sundial should be able to rotate.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_9_13": "Install the component, rotate the discs to the correct position, and you should be able to solve the trick, accessing the paper scroll within.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_3": "Alright, before we begin, do you have any questions?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_10": "Based on the samples you brought back, the Tacet Discord you defeated was an Overlord Class or higher. After defeating it, you seemingly absorbed its frequency energy with your own body.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_11": "Because you directly absorbed such a formidable Echo with your body, although you seem fine now, we can't rule out the possibility of internal changes that may have occurred. These changes may not be detectable through observation or resonance abilities.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_12": "Based on existing research reports, regardless of the threat level of an Echo, they can only be recorded and reproduced through a Terminal.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_13": "That's why I'm quite curious about how you achieved that.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_14": "After a Tacet Discord is defeated, its frequency energy, known as \"Reverberation\", may take on a physical form and remain in place.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_17": "More than that, aside from reproducing their combat abilities, a Resonator can briefly transform into the physical entity of a Reverberation if they skillfully master how to use the abilities of those shape-shifting Echoes.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_24": "What's strange is that there's not even the slightest excess fluctuation in your frequency energy...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_25": "It seems like this isn't your Resonance Ability... Can you try to reproduce the Crownless' data directly without using your Terminal?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_28": "...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_30": "Hmm... Even within your Terminal, I couldn't find the Crownless' frequency data. It seems it was indeed absorbed into your body...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_31": "The Crownless' frequency energy was \"consumed\" by your body, leaving no traces behind.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_38": "But judging from your physical condition, you're quite healthy, and your various metrics are excellent.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_39": "However, if you feel anything unusual about your body, please inform me at any time. Is that alright?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_5_40": "An Overlord Class?",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_32_6": "Well, it's not like war's a camping trip for her.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_32_7": "You're right... I'll talk with Sergeant Yanyan for some extra training later!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_32_8": "Work hard and hurry to get the chance to go to the front with her.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_32_9": "I'm so jealous. Next time we won't come here with you!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_1": "Say, child, when will the war be over?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_5": "Yes... Wars never end.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_6": "Yet those that resist will forever be with us.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_7": "Is that so...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_8": "If the day comes and I am no longer here, please witness it in my place, child.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_9": "I had a dream last night, I dreamt of a future with no wars.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_10": "But after I woke up, I realize I actually dreamt of the past.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_11": "I'm getting old now. Spent most of my years on the battlefields.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_31_13": "I'll stay for just a little longer... Then I'll be on my way.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_30_2": "... It's to help guide the soldiers back home, honey.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_30_3": "Then why isn't daddy coming home? Did he travel too far to hear the bell by accident?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_30_4": "...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_30_5": "When I get older, can I go help daddy find his way home?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_3_1": "Baizhi hasn't replied to my message. She's probably busy in her lab.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_3_2": "The man over there is Mr. Mortefi from the Department of Tacetite Weapons. Baizhi mentioned him before...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_3_3": "He might be able to help us get in touch with Baizhi, but, well... it seems we caught him at a bad time.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_1": "The previous prototype almost meets all our needs, but we're wondering if you can further optimize it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_2": "I need more specific and clear feedback.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_3": "We find it a bit hard to use. It's heavy, and the engine doesn't work that well.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_4": "Can you reduce its weight by another ten percent and double the Tacetite Energy?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_5": "I see, so you want a portable heavy tank. That's quite a BRILLIANT idea.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_6": "Yeah, you got me. There must be something you can do, right? Try to cut cost as much as you can. You can use some good materials to reduce the weight.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_7": "That's easy, but to save the R&D costs, I need you to double the R&D budget to make the weapon you want.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_8": "What do you mean? How can you save the costs when doubling the budget?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_9": "Oh? So, you know that doubling the budget won't lead to cost savings? Funny that you change the standards when you make requests.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_10": "TEST/ As for good materials, well, I see a high-quality one right in front of me—I need to send you to the Blacksmith's and give your brain a good blow!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_11": "Wh-what! You can just refuse if you can't do it! How come you get to talk nonsense!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_12": "Oh, I apologize if you felt humiliated. I thought someone presenting such an unreasonable request must have a thick skin.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_13": "Besides, didn't I just tell you?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_14": "There are no requests that I can't fulfill, but that's gonna cost extra.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_15": "How... how dare you! We're out! I'm telling you! I'm leaving!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_2_16": "I suggest you take what you can get. You can blame your bad luck for crossing paths with me, the only foreigner here at the Academy who doesn't follow that good tradition. Farewell, for good.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_1": "I'm back. I'm back! Finally done with my patrol. How's it going, Rover? Feeling spry as ever?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_2": "It sounds like I'm old.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_3": "Yeah, feeling spry as ever.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_4": "Baizhi said Rover is in great health, with no issues to report.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_5": "We've made some progress in investigating the tokens, and Rover has some inferences.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_6": "What's going on with you?",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_7": "I don't even dare imagine how desperate people were back then when I read these numbers and words. It was really a hard time. They experimented with medicines on themselves and their children. If they failed...",

    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_3": "I shattered the illusion Scar created and he must be hurt.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_4": "Hehe, should I thank you for showing me mercy?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_5": "Keep your distance from Rover!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_7": "Didn't we agree to leave some time for Rover and me?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_8": "With one condition. I do hope you haven't let that slip from your mind.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_9": "Don't let your improvisation trouble others.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_10": "Hehe, you don't have to rush to protect your fragile \"Perfect Movement\".",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_11": "Fear not, for I know what I'm doing. I know the do's and dont's. Your reminders aren't necessary.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_12": "Rover, it seems like our happy time together... must come to an end.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_13": "But do hold tight to my kind and sincere reminders.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_14": "I want to know what you'll choose: an expected gift, an open exchange, or a high-stakes gamble...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_15": "The choice is yours. I have faith in your smartness, and I believe you won't make a hasty decision.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_16": "We'll meet again in the not-too-distant future.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_17": "They are gone. Should we go after them?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_20": "I'm fine. Thank you.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_21": "Scar's Resonance Abilities appear to involve spatial transport and the creation of other dimensions. He trapped me in a confined space, and I could only sense that it wasn't far from here.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_22": "It took me quite an effort to break the illusion. My apologies for being late...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_24": "Chirp... Bro... brother...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_25": "Eh? Why is this little one here?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_27": "I've never seen Tacet Discords display such vivid emotions...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_28": "The 'brother' it referred to... Could it possibly be...?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_30": "Probably. After all, Scar has been here.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_31": "Let's set that aside for now. Rover, could you please catch me up on what happened while I was away?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_32": "This map, does it mark the location where the ritual occurred? It might hold clues about the truth of the village.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_35": "That aligns with his carefree and elusive nature.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_36": "What's the matter?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_38": "The traces left by the dual Tacet Discords' frequency fluctuation... I see.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_39": "They are unharmed. Please rest assured.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_40": "As you anticipated, Scar did not harm them... Yes, I did not intervene as you wished.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_41": "Is everything alright on your end?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_42": "Please take good care of yourself, My Lady.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_2": "...Yangyang.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_18": "...No, we don't know the true depths of their strength.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_19": "Never mind. Are you alright?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_23": "I'm glad you're alright.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_26": "It probably hid itself out of fear.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_29": "Scar...?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_33": "After all this effort, all I did was hear a fairy tale.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_34": "Alright, we should give it a check.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_70_37": "...Nothing.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_69_1": "Absolute and endless chaos...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_69_2": "Think, just think about it. What is the right path.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_1": "Very well, not even the smallest details escaped your eyes.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_2": "I'm curious about your interpretation of the village's story.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_3": "Then, I'll tell you the truth of what happened here.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_6": "In your opinion, who was the culprit behind the decreasing number of lambs?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_10": "Indeed, the direct culprit was the shepherd.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_11": "The shepherd could help them fulfill their wishes, and the lambs weren't completely ignorant of the price to be paid.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_12": "Unfortunately, in the face of such temptation, they disregarded all the hidden risks, as the disaster had yet to befall them.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_13": "If they were given another chance... I believe they still wouldn't change their decision.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_14": "Therefore, they had to accept their fate when their turn came to pay the price.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_15": "You saw past the obvious.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_16": "From a deeper perspective, the true culprits were the other white lambs who adhered to the rules set by the shepherd.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_17": "The shepherd never forced them to do anything. He merely presented a condition, giving them a chance.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_18": "Under these circumstances, as long as there were no wishes, no lambs would be killed. It's their inner greed and indifference towards others that led to the tragic consequences.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_19": "Oh? So you're standing on those white lambs' side. Do you think the culprit was the one who broke the rules?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_20": "Haha, in another version of the story, the \"black lamb\", however, vented its \"vengeful wrath\" upon the flock and the shepherd, eventually becoming the new rule-maker.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_21": "I wonder if this ending satisfies you.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_22": "Now, for the second question, what was the cost of realizing the wishes?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_26": "Indeed, nothing is more precious than life.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_27": "Surprisingly, many people are willing to risk their lives in pursuit of wealth.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_28": "To them, life lacks meaning without money.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_29": "I believe those lambs were very sincere when making their wishes.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_30": "However, that's hardly counted as a price, is it?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_31": "My final question for you, where was the black lamb?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_32": "Don't rush to give your answer, Rover. Tell me what's your interpretation of the story.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_33": "What's the truth you've deduced from the clues?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_37": "The shepherd realized the lamb's wishes by sacrificing other lambs. The flock found out the truth but chose to be his accomplices and offered the black sheep who broke the rules as a sacrifice.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_38": "Hahaha, that's right!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_39": "The shepherd realized the lamb's wishes by sacrificing other lambs and the flock didn't find out the truth. They were deceived to offer the black lamb who broke the rules as a sacrifice.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_40": "You got half of it right.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_41": "The shepherd realized the lamb's wishes by sacrificing other lambs and the flock didn't find out the truth. They were all saved.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_42": "Hehe... Do you really see it that way? In that case, you're such an innocent little lamb...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_43": "...believing a hero will suddenly show up and bring redemption.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_7": "The shepherd.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_8": "Other white lambs.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_9": "The black lamb.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_23": "Their lives.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_24": "Their wealth.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_25": "Sincerity.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_34": "The white lambs and the shepherd killed the black lamb together.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_35": "The white lambs were deceived by the shepherd and misunderstood the black lamb.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_68_36": "The flock didn't know the truth and they were all saved.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_67_1": "",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_66_1": "Later, the shepherd informed other lambs that the culprit behind the diminishing flock was the only black lamb among them.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_66_2": "In the end, those white lambs welcomed the rising sun as usual, but the black lamb was nowhere to be found.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_66_3": "The shepherd introduced rules to the village, and the black lamb violated them.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_66_4": "The concealed truth came to light. The shepherd no longer fulfilled the lambs' wishes, and there were no more sacrifices.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_66_5": "Seeing what the black lamb do and listening to the words of the highly respected shepherd, what do you suppose the white lambs did to the black lamb?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_66_6": "Those naive and stupid white lambs had no idea that the most terrifying demon walked among them all the time.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_65_1": "",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_65_2": "",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_65_3": "",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_1": "The lambs celebrated their happiness with bonfire parties day and night, reveling in the arrival of the shepherd, except for... a black lamb.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_2": "Only the black lamb discovered that the number of lambs was gradually decreasing.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_3": "Rover, do you believe that wishes can be fulfilled without paying a price?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_5": "Hehe...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_6": "I once thought that as long as you paid a sufficiently high price, you could receive equal rewards.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_7": "Yet, true quid pro quo is rarely found in this world.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_8": "From the very beginning, the world isn't fair, is it?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_9": "If you want to receive equal rewards, you have to pay more and more.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_10": "When realizing wishes means paying heavy cost, those making the wishes would think long and hard, weighing the pros and cons.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_11": "However, if the cost could be shifted onto someone else...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_12": "I'm sure everyone would rush to make more wishes without thinking that they might also become the cost for someone else's wishes to come true.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_13": "How intriguing...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_64_4": "I believe more in quid pro quo.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_1": "One day, a shepherd visited the village.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_2": "The shepherd provided them with food and shelter, fulfilling their desires, and those lambs started living a content and secure life...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_4": "No, quite the reverse. The shepherd's arrival marked the beginning of the story.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_5": "He brought these lambs the power to make their wishes come true.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_6": "All they had to do was lower their heads and implored the shepherd, and they could have more grass and safer shelter.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_7": "They no longer needed to toil as they once did, for they could now access limitless resources and relish a life of unending comfort.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_8": "So, the shepherd became the \"god\" of the lambs. They adored him, expressed their gratitude, and held him in the highest esteem...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_10": "What's wrong? I can tell from your look that you seem uncomfortable with this story.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_11": "If you were one of those lambs, facing such irresistible temptation and the pressure of peer influence, would you discard your self-esteem and beg the higher-ups for help?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_13": "Haha... I didn't expect us reaching a consensus so quickly.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_14": "You're right, but the world we live in today falls far short of your portrayal. The shepherd still exists, and the lambs have grown accustomed to his presence.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_15": "To bring that ideal world to life, it falls upon US to turn it into reality.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_3": "The story ends?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_9": "...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_63_12": "All men are created equal, and no hierarchies exist among us.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_1": "The story begins here...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_2": "In this village, there's a group of carefree and happy lambs who work hard every day to find food...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_3": "When evening fell, they would return to the village and seek refuge, protecting each other form the wolves' relentless hunt.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_5": "Throughout history, people have always enjoyed drawing lessons and uncovering truths from fables.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_6": "However, these fables often draw, to varying degrees, from the lives of people.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_7": "The same story, as told by different people, has entirely different focuses.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_8": "The lesson that the listeners learn is but one of countless interpretations.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_9": "Just like now, we're in the midst of a meticulously designed plot, and I'm not responsible for all of this.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_10": "This village marks the beginning of my connection to Jinzhou... Hehe...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_11": "It's indeed a clever move that Magistrate brought you here to meet me.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_62_4": "You enjoy telling stories.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_1": "You're back? What would you like to talk about?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_4": "I see, you want to cheat, huh?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_5": "A clever move, unbound by convention. I like it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_6": "But I'm afraid I can't tell you right now. Otherwise, your thoughts might be colored by mine, and that would make our first encounter a tedious play.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_7": "Hahaha! I refuse.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_8": "Don't try to threaten me. After all, I'm the one holding the trump card.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_2": "Give me another hint.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_61_3": "Tell me the truth.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_3": "If you need me to introduce myself once again, then... Yes, I'm Scar.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_4": "That \"cruel and twisted\" guy!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_6": "Don't you think that our much anticipated meeting should remain free of disturbances, eh?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_7": "That young lady blinds your eyes and colors your judgement.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_9": "Well, it looks like you really care about that young lady.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_10": "Relax, relax. I currently have no intentions of making you hate me... so, she is safe for now.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_11": "Well, well. Why don't we enjoy our time together for the moment, leaving the unimportant one behind? After all, we have a lot to share with each other, wouldn't you say?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_13": "You've lost your memories?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_16": "It's true, huh?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_17": "That makes sense. Otherwise, I would've questioned the authenticity of those rumors when I saw how fragile you were when you woke up.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_19": "You noticed? I'm so happy.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_20": "Don't be so hostile toward me. If you've sensed something, you should realize that I'm just one of the onlookers.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_21": "But, out of all those onlookers, I'm the only one that ventured forth to meet you, with absolute honesty.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_22": "Hehe, you're right. If you want to know, then let me tell you.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_23": "Even before you knew anything about the world, you were already the center of conflict.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_24": "From the moment a chaotic and unknown existence appeared, a fierce battle for \"possession\" has raged on.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_25": "From the moment you opened your eyes, every person you've seen, including the young lady you're concerned about, knows your role.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_26": "The world is greedy, cruelly turning a living person into a functional pawn.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_27": "That's why I'm here. You're a precious friend of mine, and I want to share the truth with you. I feel deeply sorry for everything you're about to face.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_28": "This is my sincerity.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_31": "Hehe, it seems like I can't disrupt you simply through conversation.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_32": "Well, I'd rather say I look forward to your choice.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_35": "I don't want our rare alone time to be disturbed. That's all.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_37": "Hey, don't take us for granted as the culprit...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_49": "I sense that deep down, you also harbor doubts about the individuals here.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_50": "Ah, they are right. You are quite exceptional, indeed.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_53": "The truth is far from straightforward.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_54": "First, who's the main character in this story?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_55": "An innocent young girl, a highly respected village head, and a group of homespun villagers.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_56": "Next, what's the most critical plot point?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_57": "Blind worship, wavering goodwill, well-known lies, lives taken recklessly, and that small, unique presence pushed onto a path of destruction by everyone.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_58": "Rover, the next chapter is in your hands.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_59": "I'm eager to see the story you'll narrate after you gain deeper understanding of this village.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_2": "You are... Scar?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_5": "Where is Yangyang?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_8": "What do you want?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_14": "How did you know?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_15": "You still haven't answered my question.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_18": "You followed me.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_29": "You say that as if you were any different.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_30": "You're trying to rope me into your side, aren't you?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_36": "What did the Fractsidus do to this village?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_41": "An incident with injuries.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_42": "A strange Tacet Discord.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_45": "The Fractsidus manipulated and harmed the villagers.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_46": "The villagers harmed each other.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_38": "You should be asking what happened in this village.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_39": "But revealing the truth straightforwardly is quite dull. Let's add some excitement. Why don't you tell me your thoughts?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_43": "Well done! I didn't anticipate you'd catch on to all of that!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_44": "Now, what deductions have you made from these clues?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_47": "What a cliché story! An innocent lamb and a pack of vicious wolves. Good and evil as clear as day. People tend to use this hackneyed story to fulfill their mundane fantasies and unconsciously restrain the entire world.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_48": "But do you honestly believe that real-world stories align with people's simplistic fantasies?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_51": "Your keen observation, precise judgment, and accurate understanding of human nature are admirable.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_52": "Let me share some crucial information with you.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_60_40": "A large-scale ritual.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_59_1": "It seems like some kind of wooden plaque typically used in special rituals...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_59_2": "Why would they be here? They are usually placed in the ancestral shrines.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_59_3": "And... they don't seem to be something of our time.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_59_4": "According to the historical records, there have been similar events in the past. People driven by their beliefs held large-scale ancient rituals periodically in villages.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_59_5": "Hmm... let's check other areas.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_58_1": "Rover?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_58_2": "Baizhi said earlier that those leaves showed residual TD's frequency fluctuations.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_58_3": "The final token, the leaves, is pointing there.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_58_4": "...That's the Qichi Village in the Central Plains.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_58_5": "An abandoned village...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_53": "This is... I see...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_54": "This reminds me of something the Fractsidus would do.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_55": "The Fractsidus?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_56": "Yes, but I don't know much about them. Just as an Outrider, I have dealt with cases related to it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_57": "They are a bunch of extremists keen on integrating humans with Tacet Discords. It's a large organization that has launched terror attacks of different scales in various countries.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_58": "Integrate humans with Tacet Discords...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_59": "There are signs of their activities in Jinzhou. However, those signs are left by fringe members known as \"Artificers\" within the Fractsidus.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_60": "Above the Artificers are the Overseers who serve as leaders. Overseers often possess a range of abilities, which makes them even more formidable than the Artificers.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_61": "No one knows their true intentions. Some members speak of a desire to bring about world destruction, while others claim they seek eternal power.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_62": "Among them there is one particularly insane Overseer. Even among a group of crazy extremists, he stands out.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_63": "He sees all orders as meaningless, delights in bringing destruction, and revels in chaos... I've seen these cards in the physical evidence file of the Fractsidus-related case.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_3_64": "They belonged to Scar, one of the Overseers in the Fractsidus.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_36": "I'm sorry...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_38": "No, that's beyond my ability. I just sensed some complex feelings from it... A mixture of deep sadness and eager anticipation.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_39": "Rover... I've got an idea.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_41": "It seems to be waiting for closure and redemption, but this anticipation doesn't come from it. I heard its cries... no, the cries of the village.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_42": "The village is crying, hoping to be rescued from the abyss.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_43": "test/Something truly awful happened here... Reverberations of the victims still linger.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_44": "Judging from the traces and the state of the ruins, it seems this didn't happen too long ago, and the messages carried by the wind still remain.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_45": "Perhaps it's the influence of the Tacet Field, or maybe someone was meddling in the shadows, keeping the truth hidden. However, I think...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_46": "There must be something we can do here right now. The victims may still be nearby. I can feel that those involved in all of this aren't too far away... It's dangerous here.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_47": "I'll inform Chixia about the situation. How about we continue our investigation before the official investigators arrive?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_48": "I apologize if I'm being rather subjective... It's just a hunch of mine, and I don't have any evidence to back it up.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_4_2_51": "Thank you, Rover. Please always be on your guard.",

    "HuanglongM1_1_12_35": "Ooh, reminds me of the tokens of love in those stories... It sounds like you're off to a secret date or something. What is our Magistrate planning to do with these token puzzles?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_38": "A soulmate? Hmm...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_39": "So Madam Magistrate left some hidden clues in her tokens. Clues that only the right person would be able to decipher...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_40": "But Rover has lost all memories, and would likely forget any kind of decryption method they agreed on. It doesn't quite make sense. Or maybe... She is trying to make Rover notice something else?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_41": "Rover, do you mind if we have a look at the tokens?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_42": "You showed Yangyang and Chixia the tokens.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_43": "So, what's so special about them?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_49": "A candy? I know! I've had these when I was a kid. I think they were called... Sugar pearls?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_50": "But I haven't seen anything like this in a while... Went out of trend maybe?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_51": "It reminds me of my childhood. I still remember the taste. It was so sweet.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_52": "I was really scared of getting my flu shots when I was little, and sometimes the nurse lady would hand out candies like this as a prize for being good.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_53": "But... What does it mean as a token?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_54": "It seems like... a miniature sundial.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_57": "It is a horological device that tells time by using sunlight's direction.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_58": "Sundials in Huanglong usually have marked lines for the twelve <ano=Time Periods>Shichens</ano> in a day, and every Shichen is 2 hours long, with some showing seasons or months. The design of this sundial looks a bit unusual, though...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_59": "On this sundial... Time seems to be represented by the twelve Earthly Branches, drawn on the outer ring of its surface.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_60": "And its inner ring shows the \"Four Symbols\", each representing one cardinal direction. These are the four famous auspicious beasts in Huanglong's folklore. They are believed to protect people from all four directions under heaven.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_61": "Generally, The Teal Loong represents the <color=green>East</color>, the White Tiger stands for the <color=white>West</color>, the Vermilion Bird stands for the <color=red>South</color>, and finally, we have the Black Tortoise for the <color=yellow>North</color>.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_62": "It seems this sundial is supposed to show both time and direction, but how could it work when there is not a compass attached? Not to mention the lack of sunlight basically renders it useless...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_63": "Phew. That requires way too much brain power...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_64": "The color of this leaf seems a bit odd. Can't tell what tree it is.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_65": "I think... I can feel something from it...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_66": "Hmm... Nevermind. It's too faint. Maybe it was just my imagination...",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_67": "Sorry. I can't tell what kind of tree this leaf belongs to, either.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_68": "This is... A mangosteen fruit.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_69": "Mangosteens are not native to Jinzhou. They are usually imported by boat. I think we can find more mangosteens being sold at the nearby markets.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_70": "It's not always available for purchase, though. The frequent Tacet Discord Outbreaks can disrupt transportation and cause shortages. The Midnight Rangers have greatly improved the situation in recent years, but still.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_32": "That's a three-day vacation in my books.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_36": "Maybe she is looking for a soulmate.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_37": "I have no idea.",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_44": "(Take the candy.)",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_45": "(Take the small device.)",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_46": "(Take the leaf.)",

    "HuanglongM1_1_12_48": "(Do nothing.)",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_55": "A sundial?",
    "HuanglongM1_1_12_56": "I believe so.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_9_37": "If this were related to Tacetite Weapons, it wouldn't have taken this long.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_1": "There you are. The data collected in the Gorges of Spirit has been submitted for analysis, and we'll have the result today. The equipment for your physical examinations is also prepared.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_2": "Did you find anything when you visited the City Hall?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_3": "You took out the tokens and briefed Baizhi on the meeting with Magistrate.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_4": "Have you got any ideas?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_5": "...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_9": "That's a simple method.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_10": "Data is always straightforward.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_13": "We can inquire about the other tokens too.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_14": "Mortefi is indeed the head of the Department of Tacetite Weapons.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_15": "Alright, I understand.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_16": "Please hold on for a moment.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_17": "Soon after, Baizhi returned with Mortefi.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_20": "(Show him all tokens you have.)",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_21": "I see.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_22": "Mortefi took the sundial and gently weighed it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_23": "This does look like the early handiwork of someone I know.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_25": "None of these items seem particularly unique, including this sugar pearl. Did any of you eat these sugar pearls when you were kids? Though I've never had them in my childhood.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_27": "No. I'm from the New Federation. Are you suggesting that this sugar pearl is unique to Huanglong?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_28": "Yes.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_29": "As far as I can remember, it was a candy given by a nurse.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_30": "So, this sugar pearl could lead towards a hospital?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_31": "The sugar pearl might in fact be a medicine itself. Adding sweetness to it makes it more palatable to children.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_32": "As a Huanglongnese, you've already had an idea about this, right?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_33": "Hypotheses require verification. We must confirm its material composition, backed by sufficient data, in order to arrive at a precise conclusion.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_34": "I completely agree. Let precise data confirm our speculation.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_37": "Okay.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_6": "I have a hypothesis about the sugar pearl, but it needs to be verified. If possible, I recommend testing or analyzing all the tokens without disrupting their original structures.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_7": "That's method I didn't expect.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_8": "That's a straightforward method.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_11": "The first three tokens can be handled by the lab of Department of Remnant, but this small sundial will require an X-ray testing device. You'll need to request that from the head of the Tacetite-related departments.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_12": "Tacetite-related departments... Doesn't Mr. Mortefi specialize in this field?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_18": "You can hand over the items for testing to me. If you have any specific instructions, let me know now. Return for your items in twenty minutes, and the analysis report will be ready five minutes after that. Take a right, and you'll find me in the testing room.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_19": "(Take out the sundial.)",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_24": "It's lightweight, and it doesn't match the typical sundial style. Moreover, it appears to be missing a part. See, there's a groove here.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_26": "You are not born and raised in Huanglong, are you?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_35": "The testing and analysis will take some time. If you have other matters to attend to, feel free to go ahead. I'll contact you once the results are ready.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_39_36": "Rover, shall we wait at the Academy?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_38_1": "This is Mortefi, a renowned figure in the Department of Tacetite Weapons. He was born in the New Federation and joined the Huaxu Academy a few years ago. He's competent in the field of R&D.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_38_2": "Although he seems to be distant, he's actually a man with a warm heart.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_38_3": "I heard from Chixia that he's quite popular among the kids. They often pester him to make all sorts of fanciful toys, and he's always open to their requests.",

    "InfoDisplay_31000023_Text": "March 12\nHello, I'm Hoshi. I've been living in my new home for two months now! This is the new notebook the village head gave me, and he told me I can write down the important things in it. My old home was overrun by terrifying monsters, so I journeyed for a long time to find this new place. I asked the village head when my mom and dad would catch up with me, and he assured me they'd be here to find me very soon. I hope my mom and dad can come to our new home quickly. It's so bright here, and there's a big peach tree. The city is bustling, but not many people from here go there. What's most important to me is that my mom and dad find me soon.\n...\nDecember 5\nToday marks my birthday. Everyone has been really nice to me, saying I'm their lucky charm because I can keep those monsters far away. I'm very happy, and everyone likes me. Today, we indulged in cake, birthday noodles, and I received some lovely gifts. It's been such a long time since I've seen my mom and dad. Will they return?\n...\nDecember 5\nThis marks my fourth birthday here, and the village head officially adopted me as his daughter. Before that, everyone took care of me and shared with me delicious meals. My father told me I'm a child of the Qichi Village, and I should consider myself lucky to be born as a \"child of the Qichi Village.\" I feel really fortunate to be loved by so many people. Even though my powers are still small, I'll do my best to continue protecting the village from being invaded by Tacet Discords!\n...\nJune 19\nToday, a strange big brother came to our home. He's really friendly, but for some reason, his friendliness is different from the people in the village. He seems to know a lot about me, saying \"we are of the same kind\". He told me a really strange fairy tale. The ending of the fairy tale was somewhat scary... but that big brother claimed that reality is even harsher. He asked me, \"What if you were the little black lamb from the story?\" I was left unsure how to respond, and he departed with \"See you next time.\" I told my father about it, but he said no one of that sort had visited... Who could he be?\n...\nJuly 20\nSorry... I'm so sorry... (the inked words were smudged by water) If only I weren't so weak, I could've driven away those Tacet Discords... If only they hadn't had to protect me...\nThere must be a way. My father told Xi that my Resonance Ability can manipulate the frequency of Tacet Discords, and the way she looks was only temporary. He promised to do everything in his power to get her back to her original self.\nMy father promised me. After all, he can accomplish anything. He'll surely find a way to help mend everything.\n...\n12/17\nIt's been three months since that incident. My father seems to have completely forgotten that I keep a diary... He's the one who gave me this diary. If he found out I'd been recording all this, he'd probably be furious.\nMy father orders me to obey his commands and recombine the frequencies of Tacet Discords. If the truth were to be exposed—that the missing Xi actually died protecting me, and I turned her into a Tacet Discord... it'd be enough for them to see me as a monster. I'd be banished, and no one would understand or accept my terrifying ability... except for him.\nCan the dead one really return to me through frequency recombination? If that's the case, what would the shattered soul inside that body be like?\nI don't know...\n...\n2/8\nAn increasing sense of unease continues to haunt me... the villagers are getting fewer and fewer... and those Tacet Discords my father brought back...\nI can't shake the feeling that something is awry. I'm walking down a path that leads to no future, but I can't escape, can't stop.\nI don't know what my father did... and why there's such a heavy and explosive atmosphere in the village. I haven't been allowed outside for a long time, and every time I ask about it, he just brushes me off.\nIf the price for my wish to come true is more bloodshed...\n...\n(No date)\nThe villagers have surrounded our house.\nIt appears that the truth has come to light.\nA murderer... is that how they call me? Or my father?\nAt this point, what difference does it make?\nCan someone come and save me now?\nIf it means that I must serve as the price for Qichi Village...\nIf there is a god... I hope they can...\nSave this village...\n\n(At the end of the last diary, there's a message in unfamiliar handwriting.)\n\"It seems you're luckier than you thought.\"",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_47_3": "The formidable Tacet Discord described is... the \"Crownless\".",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_46_1": "There are two photos here...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_46_2": "In one photo, there was a group of researchers, led by a woman in her thirties. Everyone looked excited and happy.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_46_3": "The other photo was of an infant still in diapers, with a slender hand holding a spoon with a sugar pearl in it, directed towards the infant.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_22": "But you're not a native here... Could it be that the place you came from had a similar situation?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_23": "With this thought, perhaps, the reports about the sugar pearl are just one part of the clues. The other part telling your past and memories is hidden in the documents on the \"Wei\" shelf. What do you think?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_24": "A hero...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_25": "Are you saying that the information contained in the sugar pearl doesn't directly point to your identity?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_26": "Jinzhou was the latest city established in Huanglong. The Mountains of Spirit running from north to south divide Huanglong into Inner Huanglong and Outer Huanglong. The City Hall and the five cities are located in the Inner Huanglong, while Jinzhou is in the Outer Huanglong.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_27": "The Battle of Gorge of Spirit was the catalyst to found Jinzhou. Tacet Discords were born in the Norfall Barrens and their invasion route was originally traceable. However, the emergence of the Crownless changed that route.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_29": "The Crownless is a Tacet Discord that embodies war itself. The hatred of the fallen warriors and the fear of the survivors are the ingredients for it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_30": "In the limited information available, some researchers have speculated its connection with the Threnodian.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_32": "When it comes to the Threnodian, there is a lot to tell. For now, you can think of it this way: the Threnodian is the most powerful Tacet Discord. The Battle of the Threnodian that happened before was to fend it off.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_33": "According to the reports, the Crownless is very much similar to the formidable Tacet Discord we encountered in the Gorges of Spirit.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_36": "The only information we are certain about is \"Wei\".",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_38": "Perhaps, the correct position is also hidden in the information indicated by other tokens.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_42": "What do you think, Rover?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_46": "I've only seen the current Magistrate from afar during the Appointment Ceremony, so I can't say for sure about her personality.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_47": "However, one thing for sure is that most of the policies implemented by Magistrate after she took office have been proved effective and greatly benefited us.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_48": "Some of these policies are remarkably far-sighted and profound, making it difficult to believe they were devised by someone so young. Therefore, there is a rumor circulating that they are largely attributed to Counselor \"Changli\".",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_52": "A counselor is an advisor to the magistrate, but it is said that Lord Changli was also a teacher to Magistrate. She once held the position of Secretary-General in the Central Secretariat but chose to come to Jinzhou.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_53": "But there are also rumors of Lord Changli as a \"sycophant\"—clever but devious, that's the word on the street.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_54": "It seems that you hold Lord Magistrate in high regard.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_55": "After all, it's just a rumor.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_56": "Of all the clues we've gathered so far, there's one thing we know for sure: the clue pointed by the sugar pearl contains information about solving the sundial mechanic box.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_57": "In other words, one token doesn't necessarily point to a single target; it may point to multiple targets, and one target may contain multiple pieces of information.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_58": "We knew that Magistrate wanted to see me because she had information she wanted to tell me, and I wanted to see her because I had questions to ask.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_59": "However, the information she wants to share may not be exactly what I'm seeking. It's possible the tokens contain both, so we'll need to put in effort to find what we're really after.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_61": "...she didn't have enough time. She could only give us clues about the first layer of information but couldn't connect these clues cleverly.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_62": "Or perhaps she's indeed a master strategist, weaving a web of interconnected tricks. The first layer of information might actually...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_65": "To ensure that anyone who unintentionally obtains these tokens cannot use them to get the information because they cannot accurately interpret them.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_66": "In other words, there are people who need to be misled, and they may obtain these tokens and get the information.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_67": "There must be an internal threat.",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_71": "Rover...",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_28": "The Crownless?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_31": "What is Threnodian?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_34": "The Gorges of Spirit again.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_39": "That's what I thought.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_40": "I enjoy solving puzzles.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_41": "What a roundabout way...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_43": "(Talk about Magistrate.)",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_44": "(Talk about all the tokens.)",

    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_50": "That's because Magistrate is discerning and skillful at utilizing talents.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_51": "Maybe not.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_60": "Or maybe...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_63": "...be a form of screening.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_64": "...be a form of misleading.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_73": "I'm such a genius.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_74": "Let's just see where this thing goes.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_16_75": "Okay, that's it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_113_1": "This should be it. It looks quite heavy.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_113_2": "Let's go back and show it to Mr. Mortefi.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_112_1": "A strange device, with a highly complex structure, and the groove inside appeared to be large enough to fit an entire arm.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_112_2": "It had a cold touch. As you pressed your arm into the groove, you touched something sharp and you felt slight pain.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_112_3": "Rover, please don't do anything dangerous!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_110_1": "The shelves were packed to the brim, filled with various research materials and books, from <i>Feasibility Report in Cooking Tacet Discords</i>, <i>Jiting Mysteries</i>, to <i>Mortise and Tenon in Huanglong—Eighty-One Techniques</i>. There were also pieces of wood and copper that didn't seem to have any apparent use, some roughly made, others finely crafted.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_110_2": "The shelves creaked under the unbearable weight. When you tried to support it, a wooden block fell squarely onto your foot.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_110_3": "You took a critical hit.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_110_4": "Ro-Rover!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_1": "What did I tell ya? Nothing like a bowl of spicy noodles in the mornin'!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_2": "How is it to your liking, Rover?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_6": "Baizhi's probably locked herself in the Academy again, says she hasn't left there since yesterday. Seems like we won't be seeing her till she's got those data all figured out.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_7": "No, wait. Considering how special you are and also the source of the data. Why don't we tie Rover up right outside Academy's front door...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_8": "And with just a few tugs of the rope, I'll bet every researcher inside will come rushing out with Baizhi leading the pack. Hook, line, and sinker!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_13": "In case of an emergency! Rover, roll out!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_14": "Oops. I got carried way. My bad!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_15": "By the way. Now that we've got a lead with the sugar pearl and the sundial, all that's left is that weird leaf and run-of-the-mill mangosteen, right?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_16": "I didn't expect us to solve half of our problems just by going to the Academy. Either Rover's really smart, or Madam Magistrate intended to make life easy for us to begin with.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_17": "What's our next plan of action, Rover?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_22": "As for the mangosteen. They're sold at the market nearby. Might find some clues there.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_23": "Mangosteen are non-native to Jinzhou and are usually transported here from the harbor. Shall we begin from there?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_26": "My shift's not up yet. If we're staying in the city, then I'll come with you and see what I can do to help!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_27": "Are you suggesting that this token is guiding us outside the city?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_28": "Baizhi mentioned that the leaf bears signs of TD Frequency Fluctuation. Which suggests the tree is grown in the vicinity of a Tacet Field.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_29": "Investigating the leaf requires us to leave the city.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_30": "Waiting it out may be a good course of action. Any plans for the next two days, Rover?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_34": "An ocean of stars... A black-haired girl... An inverted Etheric Sea... And the Resonance Chord flowing from your Tacet Mark...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_35": "The nearest heading are the Gorges of Spirit and the Norfall Barrens...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_36": "You've never mentioned this before.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_39": "The Etheric Sea and Resonance Chords are existing entities. The direction of the Resonance Chord's flow Rover mentioned indeed leads to the Gorges of Spirit and the Norfall Barrens.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_40": "Perhaps... It wasn't a dream.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_41": "Finding that young girl might be the key to recovering Rover's memories. Madam Magistrate's information aside, Rover's dream hints towards the Norfall Barrens.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_42": "Formerly the battlefields of the Threnodian War, birthplace of the TD Outbreaks, and where the Rangers' forward operating base is currently established.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_43": "The Access Pass may be another hint...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_44": "There are usually no checkpoints set up in the city besides the City Hall. An Acess Pass isn't required unless you need to visit somewhere outside Jinzhou limits.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_45": "Now why didn't I think of that? Gotta hand it to ya, Yangyang!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_46": "That's the spirit! Been beating my brains out up until now, it's time to get these muscle joints cracking for a change!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_50": "Whoooah! {Male=He;Female=She}'s fast! {Male=He;Female=She}'s furious! {Male=He;Female=She}'s a TD killing machine!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_51": "... Stop it, you two.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_52": "If we're leaving the city, then I guess it's a no-go for me, my shift's coming up. Make sure you bring Rover back in on piece and shoot me a message if you need anything, alright Yangang?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_57": "I believe in ya!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_58": "Without a doubt.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_3": "Haven't had a bite of it yet.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_4": "It's way too spicy.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_5": "Just the way I like it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_9": "Could give it a try.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_10": "Hahaha.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_11": "Enough joking around.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_12": "No need to go that far.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_18": "Look into the mangosteen first.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_19": "Look into the strange leaf first.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_20": "We've got two more days. Might as well just wait.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_21": "I have other plans.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_24": "Let's ask around at the market.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_25": "Let's see what we can find outside the city.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_31": "(Tell them about the initial dream.)",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_32": "Madam Magistrate provided me an Access Pass.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_33": "I hunger for battle!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_37": "I couldn't find the right moment.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_38": "I thought it was just a dream.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_47": "I don't know who I am.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_48": "I don't know why I'm here.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_49": "All I know is that I must kill!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_53": "I'm sure you meant the other way around.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_54": "i can hold my own.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_55": "Just wait for the good news.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_48_56": "Yangyang is safe with me.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_14": "It's the middle of the night already. Course you're tired.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_15": "It's the middle of the night already. Course you're hungry.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_16": "You betcha!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_17": "Huh? Had enough of token exploring?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_18": "Right, I promised you a meal earlier! But the night markets' all closed up shop by now, guess we'll just have to grab an early breakfast tomorrow before my shift. Meet you guys at Panhua's Restaurant in the morning. Be there or be square!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_21": "It's time to hit the bed, obviously. Don't tell me you're planning on some night activities later on?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_26": "Then the Midnight Rangers will feel right a home for ya. Or in your case, the \"Midnight Endanger\" is more like it.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_27": "Huh? Madam Magistrate can see you now? Quit bluffing.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_28": "Stop it, get some help.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_29": "Have you found a place to stay, Rover?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_34": "Talk about hospitality!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_35": "Talk about hospitality! Boy, I sure wonder how it's like to live in downtown Jinzhou.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_36": "Well, if you don't mind. We do have some vacancy in our courtyard...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_37": "Aren't you forgetting something, Yangyang? Rover already told us this morning that {Male=He;Female=She} has been offered to stay at the City Hall...",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_40": "Alright, enough chatter or the sun's gonna come up. Let's get Rover back to the City Hall and we'll leave the rest tomorrow!",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_12": "Looks like you had a fruitful day.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_13": "Do you want me to come along tomorrow?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_19": "What do we do now?",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_20": "I'll be there.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_22": "Off to some TD beatdown I go.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_23": "I've got a date with Madam Magistrate.",
    "Huanglong_main_1_2_17_24": "Won't stop till it's over!",

When the number of Echo assembled with the same Resonance reaches 2 or 5, the corresponding Resonance effect can be activated.\nMultiple Echo with the same Resonance and the same name, in a group of Echo Resonance effects, only count the number once.\nEcho with the same name may carry different Resonance due to data differences.",

You can choose any opened track to participate in the challenge.\nAfter the challenge is opened, go to the end point within the limited time, and pick up as many holographic tokens as possible in the process. When you reach the end point, the challenge score will be settled according to the number of holographic tokens obtained. The higher the score, the more rewards you can receive.\nIn the Overdashing holographic strategy track, there are various modules. Using them reasonably can reach the end point faster, but you also need to carefully identify the traps.",

    "InfoDisplay_31000024_Text": "March 12\nHello, I'm Hoshi. I've been living in my new home for two months now! This is the new notebook the village head gave me, and he told me I can write down the important things in it. My old home was overrun by terrifying monsters, so I journeyed for a long time to find this new place. I asked the village head when my mom and dad would catch up with me, and he assured me they'd be here to find me very soon. I hope my mom and dad can come to our new home quickly. It's so bright here, and there's a big peach tree. The city is bustling, but not many people from here go there. What's most important to me is that my mom and dad find me soon.\n...\nDecember 5\nToday marks my birthday. Everyone has been really nice to me, saying I'm their lucky charm because I can keep those monsters far away. I'm very happy, and everyone likes me. Today, we indulged in cake, birthday noodles, and I received some lovely gifts. It's been such a long time since I've seen my mom and dad. Will they return?\n...\nDecember 5\nThis marks my fourth birthday here, and the village head officially adopted me as his daughter. Before that, everyone took care of me and shared with me delicious meals. My father told me I'm a child of the Qichi Village, and I should consider myself lucky to be born as a \"child of the Qichi Village.\" I feel really fortunate to be loved by so many people. Even though my powers are still small, I'll do my best to continue protecting the village from being invaded by Tacet Discords!\n...\nJune 19\nToday, a strange big brother came to our home. He's really friendly, but for some reason, his friendliness is different from the people in the village. He seems to know a lot about me, saying \"we are of the same kind\". He told me a really strange fairy tale. The ending of the fairy tale was somewhat scary... but that big brother claimed that reality is even harsher. He asked me, \"What if you were the little black lamb from the story?\" I was left unsure how to respond, and he departed with \"See you next time.\" I told my father about it, but he said no one of that sort had visited... Who could he be?\n...\nJuly 20\nSorry... I'm so sorry... (the inked words were smudged by water) If only I weren't so weak, I could've driven away those Tacet Discords... If only they hadn't had to protect me...\nThere must be a way. My father told Xi that my Resonance Ability can manipulate the frequency of Tacet Discords, and the way she looks was only temporary. He promised to do everything in his power to get her back to her original self.\nMy father promised me. After all, he can accomplish anything. He'll surely find a way to help mend everything.\n...\n12/17\nIt's been three months since that incident. My father seems to have completely forgotten that I keep a diary... He's the one who gave me this diary. If he found out I'd been recording all this, he'd probably be furious.\nMy father orders me to obey his commands and recombine the frequencies of Tacet Discords. If the truth were to be exposed—that the missing Xi actually died protecting me, and I turned her into a Tacet Discord... it'd be enough for them to see me as a monster. I'd be banished, and no one would understand or accept my terrifying ability... except for him.\nCan the dead one really return to me through frequency recombination? If that's the case, what would the shattered soul inside that body be like?\nI don't know...\n...\n2/8\nAn increasing sense of unease continues to haunt me... the villagers are getting fewer and fewer... and those Tacet Discords my father brought back...\nI can't shake the feeling that something is awry. I'm walking down a path that leads to no future, but I can't escape, can't stop.\nI don't know what my father did... and why there's such a heavy and explosive atmosphere in the village.

    "InfoDisplay_31000025_Text": "March 12\nHello, I'm Hoshi. I've been living in my new home for two months now! This is the new notebook the village head gave me, and he told me I can write down the important things in it. My old home was overrun by terrifying monsters, so I journeyed for a long time to find this new place. I asked the village head when my mom and dad would catch up with me, and he assured me they'd be here to find me very soon. I hope my mom and dad can come to our new home quickly. It's so bright here, and there's a big peach tree. The city is bustling, but not many people from here go there. What's most important to me is that my mom and dad find me soon.\n...\nDecember 5\nToday marks my birthday. Everyone has been really nice to me, saying I'm their lucky charm because I can keep those monsters far away. I'm very happy, and everyone likes me. Today, we indulged in cake, birthday noodles, and I received some lovely gifts. It's been such a long time since I've seen my mom and dad. Will they return?\n...\nDecember 5\nThis marks my fourth birthday here, and the village head officially adopted me as his daughter. Before that, everyone took care of me and shared with me delicious meals. My father told me I'm a child of the Qichi Village, and I should consider myself lucky to be born as a \"child of the Qichi Village.\" I feel really fortunate to be loved by so many people. Even though my powers are still small, I'll do my best to continue protecting the village from being invaded by Tacet Discords!\n...\nJune 19\nToday, a strange big brother came to our home. He's really friendly, but for some reason, his friendliness is different from the people in the village. He seems to know a lot about me, saying \"we are of the same kind\". He told me a really strange fairy tale. The ending of the fairy tale was somewhat scary... but that big brother claimed that reality is even harsher. He asked me, \"What if you were the little black lamb from the story?\" I was left unsure how to respond, and he departed with \"See you next time.\" I told my father about it, but he said no one of that sort had visited... Who could he be?\n...\nJuly 20\nSorry... I'm so sorry... (the inked words were smudged by water) If only I weren't so weak, I could've driven away those Tacet Discords... If only they hadn't had to protect me...\nThere must be a way. My father told Xi that my Resonance Ability can manipulate the frequency of Tacet Discords, and the way she looks was only temporary. He promised to do everything in his power to get her back to her original self.\nMy father promised me. After all, he can accomplish anything. He'll surely find a way to help mend everything.\n...\n12/17\nIt's been three months since that incident. My father seems to have completely forgotten that I keep a diary... He's the one who gave me this diary. If he found out I'd been recording all this, he'd probably be furious.\nMy father orders me to obey his commands and recombine the frequencies of Tacet Discords. If the truth were to be exposed—that the missing Xi actually died protecting me, and I turned her into a Tacet Discord... it'd be enough for them to see me as a monster. I'd be banished, and no one would understand or accept my terrifying ability... except for him.\nCan the dead one really return to me through frequency recombination? If that's the case, what would the shattered soul inside that body be like?\nI don't know...\n...\n2/8\nAn increasing sense of unease continues to haunt me... the villagers are getting fewer and fewer... and those Tacet Discords my father brought back...\nI can't shake the feeling that something is awry. I'm walking down a path that leads to no future, but I can't escape, can't stop.\nI don't know what my father did... and why there's such a heavy and explosive atmosphere in the village. I haven't been allowed outside for a long time, and every time I ask about it, he just brushes me off.\nIf the price for my wish to come true is more bloodshed...\n...\n(No date)\nThe villagers have surrounded our house.\nIt appears that the truth has come to light.\nA murderer... is that how they call me? Or my father?\nAt this point, what difference does it make?\nCan someone come and save me now?\nIf it means that I must serve as the price for Qichi Village...\nIf there is a god... I hope they can...\nSave this village...\n\n(At the end of the last diary, there's a message in unfamiliar handwriting.)\n\"It seems you're luckier than you thought.\"",
